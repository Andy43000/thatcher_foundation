</p>, <p>If she is successful, she will become one of the youngest members of the fair sex ever to take her seat in Parliament. She has, in fact, already made history for at the moment she is the youngest prospective woman Tory candidate in the country.

</p>, <p>She is Miss Margaret Roberts, the 23 years-old daughter of Ald. and Mrs. A. Roberts, of North-parade, Grantham, who was recently chosen from a short-list as prospective Tory candidate for the constituency of Dartfortd, at present a fairly heavily-held Labour seat.

</p>, <p>It is a large constituency with a population of between 70,000 and 80,000. At the last election <span class="nm">Norman Dodds</span>the Socialist candidate, a publicity agent, secured a majority of 19,714 in a straight fight against a Conservative nominee.

</p>, <p>Miss Roberts told me that Conservative supporters at Dartford were quietly confident that there was a good chance this time of winning the seat back.

</p>, <p> “I think that, probably with vigorous campaigning, it can be done” , she said, “though there is not so much time left.” 

</p>, <p>The adoption meeting , by the way, takes place in about a fortnight.

</p>, <p></p>, <p>You may be interested to know the circumstances which led her to seek Parliamentary honours.

</p>, <p>A close friend was seated next to the chairman of the Dartford Division at the Llandudno Conference. During the proceedings <span class="nm">J.L.M. Miller</span>the Dartford chairman mentioned that they were on the lookout for a candidate.

</p>, <p> “I think I know someone” , said Miss Roberts' friend, and that was how Miss Roberts came into the picture.

</p>, <p>A few days ago, she was interviewed as a member of a short-list of three, and then came that announcement that she had been chosen as prospective candidate.

</p>, <p></p>, <p>A native of Grantham, Miss Roberts is an old girl of Kesteven and Grantham School and took her B.Sc degree in chemistry at Oxford. Since September 1947, she has been with B.X. Plastics at Manningtree as a research chemist.

</p>, <p>In the 1945 Michaelmas term she was president of the Oxford University Conservative Association, and was the third woman to receive that honour.

</p>, <p> “Politics take up most of my spare time, but I am very keen on music” , Miss Roberts told me.

</p>, <p>At the last General Election, she undertook quite a lot of speaking on behalf of Sqd-Ldr. G.A. Worth, both at Grantham and at Sleaford.

</p>, <p>In her address, Miss Roberts attacked the Government's approach to the economic situation, and put forward several alternative policies to guide Britain along the road to recovery. She stressed that Imperial Preference was still the cornerstone of Conservatism.

</p>, <p>A collection was taken and the 400 who crowded the hall contributed £37 13s. towards election expenses. This was doubled by an anonymous supporter of the association who does not live in the Division.

</p>, <p>Mr. A. Morris Wheeler (president) was in the chair, and on the platform were Mr. J. L. M. Miller (Divisional chairman), Miss Mary Hamilton (Divisional chairman, Young Conservatives), Mrs. D. M. Fletcher (women's Divisional chairman), Mr. Hugh Goff, Mr. E. Tranter (Central Office, S.E. area), Miss Roberts and her father.

</p>, <p>An explanation of the process by which the selection was made was given by Mr. J. L. M. Miller, who said four prominent local business men had been approached previously and had declined. He had first met Miss Roberts at the Conservative Conference and soon realised she would make a suitable candidate.

</p>, <p>He said Miss Roberts was sincere about her faith and was brilliant. She was blessed with the gift of eloquence: he wished her success, and pledged the support of the association.

</p>, <p>Miss Roberts began by asking what benefits ordinary people had received after 3½ years of Socialism. The Government should do what any good housewife would do if money was short—look at their accounts and see what was wrong.

</p>, <p>They should investigate how they could produce things more cheaply and buy food and raw materials more economically. Certain extravagant articles should most certainly not be purchased at all.

</p>, <p>Bulk-buying was responsible for many of the present food shortages and high prices, she said. When the Government first instituted the system during the war they believed it would be cheaper, but unfortunately theory and practice were not the same.

</p>, <p>Although industrialists were attempting to find ways of reducing production costs and thus lower the price of goods, the greatest item on accounts was always raw material. Bulk buying of raw material had pushed prices up and Britain was paying more than other nations.

</p>, <p>What incentive was there for the working-man to produce more, Miss Roberts asked? If he put in a few hours overtime he only saw a few shillings of his extra money, the rest went in taxes to pay for the Government's mistakes.

</p>, <p>If there was some tax relief she believed production figures would rise and in the end prices would fall. Industrialists should also have the burden of heavy taxes lightened, and then they could put money back into their business and modernise machinery.

</p>, <p>If Socialists continued with their disastrous policy, unemployment and other evils would result and the working people would suffer.

</p>, <p>Britain under Conservatism would stand with the Empire, and she called on members not to be ashamed that they belonged to such a great family.

</p>, <p>When Britain was faced with the armed might of Germany, it was members of the Empire who came across the world to fight for the Mother Country. Now Britain should stand beside her Dominions and Colonies to fight the economic war and follow the road to recovery together.

</p>, <p>Several members of the audience paid tribute to Miss Roberts for her address and assured her of their support.

</p>, <p>The proposal that Miss Roberts be adopted was moved by Mr. J. L. M. Miller and seconded by Mrs. D. M. Fletcher. The motion was supported by Mr. J. F. L. Gates (Erith), Mr. A. Garrett (Erith), Mrs. A. Jenns (Dartford), Mr. R. Porter (Dartford) and Mr. J. W. Panton.

</p>, <p>When the vote was taken only one of the 400 present raised his hand against Miss Roberts' adoption. As she returned to the hall cheering and clapping greeted her.

</p>, <p>A bouquet of carnations was presented to the candidate by Miss M. Hamilton, who said the Young Conservatives were “terribly bucked” that a young person had been selected.

</p>, <p>Replying, Miss Roberts said nowhere could she find such kindhearted people as in that Division. She thanked members for the way in which they had received her. She would commence her activities shortly, and hoped to hold meetings at local factories and, if necessary, open-air meetings.

</p>, <p>Speakers included Alderman Roberts, a former Mayor of Grantham, who said by tradition his family were Liberal, but the Conservative Party to-day stood for very much the same things as the Liberal Party did in his young days.

        </p>][<p id="section">Speeches, Interviews &amp; Other Statements</p>, <p id="description">Complete list of 8,000+ Thatcher statements &amp; texts of many of them</p>, <p class="nonmt">That those pledged to fight the evils of Socialism will be the mainstay of the future of this country was agreed when the annual report of the Executive Council of Dartford Conservative and Unionist Association was approved at the annual meeting of the association held at the Bull Hotel, Dartford, on Thursday last week.

</p>, <p>Miss Margaret Roberts, prospective Conservative candidate for the Division, claimed that if the present rate of Government expenditure went on and the budgets were as high as they had been since 1945 the present Government would in five years have spent as much as all the Governments between the wars.

</p>, <p>Miss Roberts said that at the end of the war we had practically no overseas investments left; lease - lend was about to end, and the country had to pay her way with visible exports. Fortunately, America came to our aid. The Conservatives did not altogether approve of the way that loan was negotiated, and they abstained from voting on the question. In course of time their opinions were proved right.

</p>, <p>In 1946 came the wheat crisis. Again the Conservatives were right. Then there was the fuel crisis, the result of which was a loss to the export drive of £200,000,000. That money would have paid for five years' supply of tobacco, lost for want of just 5,000,000 tons of coal.

</p>, <p> “Had the Tories been in power, there would have been the biggest outcry against a Government ever known; somehow we Tories do not seem to bring home the faults of the Socialist Government as much as they would have done if the boot had been on the other foot,” declared Miss Roberts.

</p>, <p>The dollar crisis was next on the list. This still existed. This Government would, she claimed, have gone out of power had it not been for the extreme generosity of “our American friends.” 

</p>, <p>A new problem was arising. For the past few years the cry had been “Produce more, produce more.” Now a condition had been added, “Produce more at a cost which your customers can pay.” Already there were signs that we were having difficulty in selling our goods. The battle of to-day was the driving down of the cost of production.

</p>, <p>It had been asked if the present benefits under social security would have existed had a Conservative Government been in power. Miss Roberts referred her listeners to the days of 1941, when the Coalition Government (with a Conservative majority) set up under Sir William Beveridge a National Health Service Committee. At a later date, five main propositions were accepted. There should be a comprehensive scheme to cover everybody, a similar industrial injuries insurance scheme, family allowances, a national health service and national assistance, with an abolishing of the old Poor Law system. All of these principles, involving tremendous new plans, were well on the way to being completed when the Conservatives went out of office.

</p>, <p></p>, <p>Mr. Churchill had said that it would be a crime on the part of any Government to allow the value of people's savings to depreciate. “That is precisely what has happened,” said Miss Roberts. During the first nine months of the financial year, withdrawals from savings for the first time exceeded savings by £18,000,000.

</p>, <p>People had to have something over in order to save up some capital for themselves—enough for them to feel that in the event of a rainy day they could tide themselves over. Miss Roberts stressed that the security a family could have by saving its own money, buying its own house and investing, was far better than the ordinary security one would get from any national scheme.

</p>, <p>One of the first actions of any Conservative Government had to be the reduction of taxation. It could be done if Government extravagance was decreased. “If the present rate of Government expenditure goes on and the Budgets are as high in the next year as in the last four, this Government, in its five years of office, will have spent as much as all the Governments from 1918 to 1939,” stated the speaker.

</p>, <p>Mr. J. F. L. Gates proposed a vote of thanks to Miss Roberts, which was seconded by Mrs. A. Jenns.

</p>, <p>Mr. A. Morris Wheeler was re-elected president of the association, and other officers re-elected were Mr. J. L. M. Miller (chairman), Mr. Hugh Goff (vice-chairman) and Mr. W. E. D. Kelsey (hon. treasurer). Mrs. D. M. Fletcher and Miss M. Hamilton are also vice-chairmen.

</p>, <p>Mr. Morris Wheeler said that in the selection of Miss Roberts as prospective candidate, the committee had probably had in mind that her father was a big Liberal worker, and that she would get not only Liberal support in voting, but also Liberal support in working.

</p>, <p>The president reported that Mr. J. Rupert Mitchell had invited the association to take over the lease of part of his premises in Spital-street, and they were very grateful.

</p>, <p>It was agreed to send a letter to Mr. Mitchell, who is in hospital, wishing him a speedy recovery.

</p>, <p>In the annual report, presented by the chairman and the secretary, it was stated that during 1948 membership of the association had increased by more than 150 per cent.

</p>, <p>The Young Conservatives organisation continued to flourish, and a Young Conservative Divisional Council had been formed to co-ordinate the work of the two branches.</p>, <p>Copyright © Margaret Thatcher Foundation 2018. All Rights Reserved.
        </p>][<p id="section">Speeches, Interviews &amp; Other Statements</p>, <p id="description">Complete list of 8,000+ Thatcher statements &amp; texts of many of them</p>, <p class="nonmt"> “The Budget once again is an austerity budget. For a long time past Conservatives have been advocating the need for a reduction in taxes, and it is no mere election stunt. This country has stood austerity for a long time and been very heroic about it, but heroism is an expendable asset and cannot go on for ever.” 

</p>, <p>So said Miss Margaret Roberts, B.A., B.Sc., prospective Conservative candidate, speaking at a luncheon arranged by Dartford Division Women Conservatives at Electricity House, Erith, on Thursday last week. She added that in the Budget the human factor had been forgotten.

</p>, <p>Mrs. G. W. R. Fletcher was in the chair, and with her were Mrs. Morris Wheeler (president) and members of the association executive, also Messrs. J. W. Panton (vice-president), J. M. L. Miller (chairman) and Hugh Goff (vice-chairman) of the Divisional Association.

</p>, <p>It was a great occasion for the women's organisation, said the chairman, as not only were they meeting their newly-adopted candidate ( “I am sure you all agree we have made a very wise choice” ), but also their newly-elected president.

</p>, <p>Having congratulated the chairman and her helpers on the success of the luncheon, which was attended by representatives of the various branches in the Division, Miss Roberts expressed her determination of getting to know members individually and was certain they would meet her half-way.

</p>, <p>Recalling the days of “V” bombs and rockets and the way in which people stood up to them, Miss Roberts said it was the same with austerity. It could not go on for ever, and Sir Stafford Cripps was just looking at the facts and figures; failing to take into account the human beings and human factors behind those facts and figures. Production was not only a matter of “man hours,” but of men and women being encouraged by words of praise when needed.

</p>, <p>A few days ago a student said to her: “We look at things these days with too much superficial abstraction.” That was true. Looking at people, they viewed them as “youth,” or as “men” or “women” —as a word and not as human beings. That was precisely what was bound to happen under nationalised planning, with the “pigeonhole mind” in command, able to move men from one mine or one factory to another if production fell off, as if 100 men were just one mass.

</p>, <p><span class="nm">Sir Stafford Cripps</span>The Chancellor had said he could not reduce the Budget under the present rate of expenditure. Maybe that was so, but why not reduce expenditure? The speaker instanced the size of administrative staffs.

</p>, <p> “These staffs are paid by, you and me; paid to tell us what we are to do. We must be careful what orders we take from them.” 

</p>, <p>She then referred to various items which had involved the country in loss. Bulk buying could be cut, saving millions of pounds, and so reduce taxation, thus putting extra money into people's pockets, encouraging them to work harder and so produce more goods.

</p>, <p>An instance of an administrative mistake was the sending of ships to Archangel to ship timber, but the ships were too large to enter the port and had to return under ballast. Private enterprise might make mistakes but if it did the cost was borne by the people making the mistake and not by the taxpayers as a whole.

</p>, <p>In 1938 the Board of Trade received 45,000 letters a month, but now it was 1,250,000, a large proportion of which referred to permits and licences. It was true the <span class="nm">Harold Wilson</span>President of the Board had made an attempt to cut controls, but it was quite impossible for one man to do all the pruning.

</p>, <p>Mr. Strachey bought potatoes when the country did not need them and that cost £10,000,000, which was half the subsidy, hence people now had to pay more for their butter and cheese as a result of that blunder.

</p>, <p>Miss Roberts also referred to the ground nuts scheme in Central Africa, when-all the time ground nuts were going to waste in West Africa.

</p>, <p>Having instanced other examples of waste, she said she was convinced the Government could cut down extravagant expenses if they had the will to do so.

</p>, <p>Miss Roberts was thanked by Messrs. Panton and Miller, the former urging members to help Miss Roberts to become known in the Division; the latter saying it was not a question of whether Miss Roberts was worthy of them, but whether they were worthy of Miss Roberts.</p>, <p>Copyright © Margaret Thatcher Foundation 2018.

</p>, <p>Five members, Messrs. J. Cufley, A. Denny, W. Traynor, F. Willson and R. Divall, received the A.C.C. distinguished service medal, or bars to the medal in recognition of long service. These were presented by Miss Roberts.

</p>, <p>In the absence of the presdent, Colonel the Hon. Angus McDonnell, C.M.G., C.B., owing to the death of his mother (Louisa, Countess of Antrim), the chair was taken by Mr. J. Cash, and with him were Mr. A. Hutchins (secretary) and other officers of the club.

</p>, <p>Mr. J. Beaumont praised the work of the chairman, secretary, committee, steward and stewardess, and hoped the club would continue in the prosperity and happiness of the past 20 years.

</p>, <p>A little diffident in replying, since he was not a member, Mr. A. R. Ward (auditor) assured members that their club really was in a sound condition. He sounded the warning that with a general election approaching they must redouble their efforts to raise funds for the fight.

</p>, <p>Submitting “The Cause,” Miss Roberts said the Socialists were now admitting for the first time what Conservatives had been saying for years—that the people must pay for the social services. No one minded paying for service, but they did object to paying for mistakes, and wanted value for money.

</p>, <p>Socialism had been defined as “Weeping, wailing and national teeth.” They certainly did not want to use those teeth for weeping and wailing.

</p>, <p>Turning to recent events in China, Miss Roberts said they contained a lesson for all, and emphasised the division of the world into two camps. The “cold war” was as dangerous as any war in the past, and must be stopped unless the world was to go the way of Communism. Socialists in the past had flirted with Communim, therefore it was obvious the one and only effective barrier was Conservatism.

</p>, <p> “We have never toyed with that creed and we have never sung the ‘Red Flag.’ Our plain duty is to do everything we can to put the people on the path to our ideals,” said Miss Roberts. Their cause was to make certain men and women were allowed to use their talents and abilities to <i>[sic]</i> they wished, provided they did no harm to others, that all might live decently and freely.

</p>, <p>Mr. R. W. Mills (Divisional agent) urged members to remember that the Cause was something more than social functions, and that when it came to an election they were not voting for their champion, although in Miss Roberts they had a worthy one.

</p>, <p> “Whenever I visit you I find something being done by or to Fred Willson, who to-night is receiving his sixth bar,” said Mr. D. Cornfoot, responding to the welcome to “The Visitors,” submitted by Mr. J. Cufley.

</p>, <p>Mr. F. Bryant said all were proud of their local Press and its absolute impartiality.

</p>, <p>Mr. C. Fred House, F.J.I. (Editor, <i>Erith Observer</i>) responded.

</p>, <p>Praising “Our Chairman,” Mr. C. Knapp (vice-chairman) said his first memory of Mr. Cash was in the good old days of that band of sportsmen, Picardy Rovers. Mr. Cash was the same good sportsman, to-day, loyal to the club and the Cause.

</p>, <p>The chairman briefly acknowledged the tribute, but felt the credit was due to the committee. All tried to play the game and do their best for the members.

</p>, <p>Miss Roberts then presented the medals and bars to: Medals (5 years service), J. Cufley, A. Denny. W. Traynor; sixth bar (21 years), F. Willson; second bar (10 years), R. Divall.

Chapman and Erith Labour League of Youth, followed addresses by the prospective Parliamentary candidate and Municipal candidates at a Conservative election meeting at Electricity House, Erith, on Tuesday.

</p>, <p>Mr. H. Winn presided, and speakers were Miss Margaret Roberts, Mr. J. Daynes (Abbey Wood), Mr. J.F.L. Oates (North-umberland Heath), and Mr. G. McMillan (Old Church).

</p>, <p>Mr. R. Marsh (chairman, Erith Labour League of Youth) asked Mr. Daynes why he attacked bulk buying, when it was carried out by the same buyers who formerly operated for private enterprise?

</p>, <p>Mr. Daynes replied that, whereas before the war British merchants searched the markets of the world for whatever commodities the people wanted, today citizens had to eat what the Government selected.

</p>, <p>Mr. G. McMillan quoted the Prime Minister as writing in 1933: “I conceive the District Commissioner as something more than a public serveant. He is a local energiser and interpreter of the will of the Government. He is not impartial. He is a Socialist, and therefore in touch with Socialists in the region, who are his colleagues in the campaign.’ This statement reminded him (Mr. McMillan) of the Soviet system of commissars.

</p>, <p>Mr. Marsh asked Mr. McMillan if he had read the complete address, or “if he had got the paragraph from a Central Office newsletter?” He asked him to deny that he had not read the complete article, and claimed that the quotation had been lifted from its context.

</p>, <p>Replying, Mr. McMillan said he would not deny that he had not read the booklet, and that if a book did not interest him he “skimmed through it.” Although he apologised for not knowing the following paragraph, he thought it could not have been important enough to impress him.

</p>, <p>[A <i>Kentish Times</i> reporter found the subsequent paragraph in the Labour Party publication “Talking Points.” It is: “I regard the commissioners as acting only in the emergency period during which plans for the future local government of the country will be in process of formation.” ]

</p>, <p>The Conservative attitude to old age pensions was questioned by Mrs. L. A. Forbes (hon. secretary, Erith Old Age Pensions Association).

</p>, <p>Miss Roberts told Mrs. Forbes it was too early for her to say what would be done in that sphere. The Conservative Party realised that £1 6s. was worth less now than when it was instituted, and when genuine hardship was proved they believed in granting supplementary pensions. However, her party would rather decrease prices and make money go farther.

</p>, <p>A statement by Miss Roberts, who alleged that the Labour Party exercised a rigid control over their councillors, was denied by Councillor Chapman, who said there was no machinery in his party's constitution to allow for the expulsion of a councillor who did not “toe the party line.” 

</p>, <p>Referring to the recent Council house rents dispute, a lady in the audience asked why Councillor J. Watkins was expelled when he opposed the majority on the increased rents issue.

</p>, <p> “Councillor J. Watkins was not expelled for opposing the group, but for his general attitude,” retorted Councillor Chapman.

</p>, <p>Claiming that the Labour Party theory was not always its practice, Miss Roberts said that although the Socialists might not expel a representative, they could withdraw the Whip from him. When an election came, an official candidate with party support could stand against him.

</p>, <p>There were several other questions on the relationship of the Conservative Association and E.R.R.A., the housing situation, Conservative policy, and the National Health Act.

</p>, <p>Miss Roberts 's stated that £200,000,000 was lost in exports, just because of the shortage of 5,000,000 tons of coal; could we know what the Conservatives would have done to get this extra coal?

<span class="comment"><i>Erith Observer</i>, 13 May 1949</span> </p>, <p class="mt">Dear Sir.—Your correspondent, Mr. Richard W. Marsh, in your issue of April 29, asked for further information on some points raised in a speech of mine which he said was reported in your columns of “last week” (April 22). I take it his request refers to the report of the Conservative annual meeting held on March 31, which was reported in your issue of April 8.

</p>, <p>To deal with his queries in the order raised:—

</p>, <p>1. Fuel Crisis.—For want of 5 000,000 tons of coal in this country, the export drive suffered (according to the Government's own estimate) to the extent of £200,000,000. The question Mr. Marsh asks is, what Conservatives would have done to get this extra coal, but that is not the only point to be considered in relation to the fuel crisis; the other one is—had the coal supplies been used economically and to the best advantage, should we have found ourselves short of 5,000,000 tons?

</p>, <p>To take the latter point first, there are a number of factors to be considered. The Minister of Fuel and Power, Mr. E. Shinwell, was continually warned that our reserves of coal were dangerously low but he refused to admit it. Now, unless you admit a situation exists, you can do nothing to remedy it. As late as October 24, 1946, when our supplies were already 5,000,000 tons below the safety level, he said: “Everybody knows there is going to be a serious crisis in the coal industry except the Minister of Fuel and Power …” How right he was! He continued: “There is not going to be a crisis if by crisis you mean that industrial organisation is going to be seriously dislocated and hundreds of factories are to be closed down.” 

</p>, <p>Had he heeded Conservative warnings through the summer of 1946 he could: (i.) have told the country openly of the dangerous position when far greater efforts towards economy would have been made all round; (ii.) have prevented the export of 9,000,000 tons of coal in bunkering and otherwise which took place that year. If five of that 9,000,000 tons had been kept in this country, our reserves would have been safe; (iii.) have warned <span class="nm">Hugh Dalton</span>the Chancellor of the Exchequer not to take off purchase tax from electrical appliances, thus encouraging increased fuel consumption when our coal stocks could least afford it. Had these measures been taken the fuel crisis could have been averted.

</p>, <p>As to the former point of what Conservatives would have done to get more coal, let us first see what the Coalition Government did in a previous year with a comparable labour force.

</p>, <p>Average No. of

Year.

Wage-earners.

Coal Output

1941

…   . 697,600

206.344,000

1946

…   . 696,700

189,300,000

</p>, <p>In 1941, therefore, with a labour force of approximately the same as in 1946 the methods of administration and production used by the Coalition Government secured a far greater output of coal than a Socialist Government five years later. The proof of the pudding is in the eating! A Government predominantly Conservative did it in 1941.

</p>, <p>One of the principal factors in the lower output for 1946 is the high rate of absenteeism, which was twice as great as in pre-war years. The cause of this is to be found in the high taxation rate which offers little financial incentive to the wage-earners to produce more. Conservatives have long advocated a reduction in taxation, which I shall deal with under Mr. Marsh 's fourth point.

</p>, <p>A second factor is that the emphasis in 1946 was on a changing ownership, and not on greater production. For fuller details of this point I would refer your readers to two pamphlets produced by the Conservative Party on “The Organisation of the Coal Board.” by C. G Lancaster, M.P., and “Inside Industry—Coal.” Both can be obtained through Conservative head-quarters at 74. Spital-street. Dartford.

</p>, <p>The lack of generating plant had nothing to do with the fuel crisis.

</p>, <p>2. Production Costs.—The two chief lines of approach towards reducing production costs are: (a) reduction of overheads. (b) reduced costs of raw materials.

</p>, <p>Under (a) comes the whole question of Government forms, licences and permits, which necessitate a large proportion of non-productive workers in every industry, which puts up the cost of the finished article. For example talking about the coal industry a moment ago, in the United States the proportion of productive to non-productive workers is 72 per cent.; here it is 26 per cent., a margin which is too wide to admit of purely technical explanation. Conservatives have never advocated the complete abolition of all controls, but there are many which hold up production, and which it would be beneficial to the nation to reduce. I quote examples of the cumbersome operation of two controls:—

</p>, <p>(i.) “The Government have allowed a British industrialist to spend 50 000 dollars from United States credits to import a plant designed to burn only 25 per cent. of the coal normally used in soap manufacture, but they have refused him the 45 tons of constructional steel which he must have to house the machinery … The equipment has therefore been tied up in packing cases in a Merseyside warehouse for the last month.” —( “Daily Mail,” August 19, 1948.)

</p>, <p>(ii.) “Farmers in Scotland working night and day to save the harvest from floods have been ordered by the Department of Agriculture to answer 199 questions by September 15—many of them about domestic fittings in their homes. If they do not answer states the department. They are liable to heavy penalties. There are 143 questions relating to crops and livestock, and 56 additional queries about the supplies of water and electricity on their farms. For example, farmers must state the number of electric lamps used in the farmhouse in their cottages, and on the farm. Mr. D. Chalmers Watson, an East Lothian farmer, said yesterday, ‘It is appalling. Last time we had to count the number of taps in the bathrooms and washbasins. Now we have to check up on bedside lamps at a time when we are concerned about the harvest’.” —( “Sunday Express,” Sept. 5, 1948.)

</p>, <p>If controls such as these were cut, overhead charges would be reduced and non-productive workers released for productive work.

</p>, <p>Under “reduced costs of raw materials” comes the question of Government bulk purchase, which often results in the manufacturer having to pay a higher price for his raw material than he would if he bought it privately.

</p>, <p>In a number of industries, the one in which I personally am engaged, for example (production of xylonite), the largest factor in the costing of the finished article is the cost of the raw materials. It is therefore of prime importance that this should be reduced by every means possible. Examples of some of the needlessly high prices this system is affording as are as follows:—

</p>, <p>(i.) Copper in Britain is now £24 a ton dearer than in New York, lead £18 a ton dearer, zinc £24 dearer. At present rates of consumption a burden of £1½ has been laid on British manufacturers in the past month.

</p>, <p>(ii.) Last autumn. J. and P. Coats, who are large users of Egyptian Karnade cotton, pointed out their requirements to the Cotton Buying Commission at a time when that cotton was 29d. per lb., and suggested that the Government should buy. The Commission knew better, and did not buy. Later the cotton had to be bought at prices up to COd. per 1b.

</p>, <p>For further discussion and examples, please refer to a pamphlet obtainable from Conservative headquarters at Dartford called. “The State as Merchant.” 

</p>, <p>Another factor not to be dismissed lightly is the increasing cost of coal and fuel under nationalisation which again puts up manufacturing costs.

</p>, <p>Wage reductions are certainly no part of Conservative policy, but we believe that production costs could be reduced along the lines indicated above. <span class="page">[end p2]</span>
</p>, <p>3. National Health Scheme.—The situation up to 1945 was, briefly, as follows: The original steps to set up a National Health Service were taken during the Coalition Government when Mr. Ernest Brown (Liberal National) was Minister of Health. The conception of a National Health Service was put forward in 1942 by Sir William Beveridge (Liberal) and actively developed by Mr. Henry Willink, K.C., M.P., who succeeded Mr. Brown at the Ministry of Health. Mr. Willink published the first draft scheme in a White Paper in January, 1944. The principles of this scheme were debated and endorsed by the House of Commons on March 16 and 17, 1944. By the end of May, 1945 as a result of discussions which Mr. Willink had held with the medical profession, a stage had been reached where legislation could be drafted with the approval of the doctors. The Socialist Government abandoned these discussions and introduced a measure which departed from certain important principles from the Coalition scheme.

</p>, <p>(i.) The Socialist Act transfers the premises and equipment of both voluntary and municipally-owned hospitals to the Minister of Health, diverting the trust funds of voluntary hospitals to purposes other than those intended by the donors. The Coalition scheme provided for a fully organised plan of hospitals in which the voluntary hospital system would continue side by side with municipal hospitals.

</p>, <p>(ii.) The terms offered to general practitioners, particularly in respect to (a) remuneration; (b) the buying and selling of practices; (c) the refusal to allow doctors dismissed from public service on the grounds of inefficiency the right of appeal to the court, were not considered satisfactory by Conservatives. Amendments designed to secure better conditions were rejected by the Government. The Conservative Opposition did not feel it could vote for a Bill which retained such conditions which were likely to antagonise the medical profession. They rightly considered that the first condition of a successful health scheme was to have the full co-operation of the doctors.

</p>, <p>As the Opposition had anticipated, the medical profession did consider the terms unsatisfactory and there arose a dispute between the B.M.A. and the Government, which was aggravated by the high-handed conduct of the Minister of Health, Mr. Bevan. This continued well into 1948, and for a time it looked as if the health scheme was in jeopardy until Mr. Bevan climbed down in April, 1948. He gave way on the question of a universal basic salary and he had to agree to introduce amending legislation to make it impossible to introduce a full-time State Medical Service by way of regulation without another Act of Parliament. In addition, he promised to appoint a legal committee to inquire into the effect of the Act on partnership agreements.

</p>, <p>In these and other ways, he has had to fall into line with Conservative criticisms which he had previously resisted. As a result of the modifications, the B.M.A. decided to recommend that the doctors should co-operate in the new scheme.

</p>, <p>4. Reduced Taxation.—I did not have in mind reductions in either the social services or the food subsidies when I spoke of cutting down taxation. It would be possible to reduce taxation if fewer mistakes were made by Government departments and if they would (i) curb their expenditure and (ii.) get value for money for every pound spent. Just as it is possible for one family to make, say, £7 per week, go further than another, so it is with governments.

</p>, <p>A few examples of Government extravagance and mistakes are as follows:—

</p>, <p>(i.) Potatoes.—Mr. Strachey is making big losses on a contract under which he bought 50,000 tons of potatoes from Southern Ireland growers. He is paying the growers about £10 10s. per ton but large quantities are being sold back to alcohol factories at £3 to £4 per ton, therefore making a loss of £6 per ton, for which the taxpayer suffers.

</p>, <p>(ii.) Onions.—Onions are being left to rot in the fields of East Anglia while large quantities are being imported. The secretary of the Isle of Ely branch of the N.F.U. estimated that 26,000 tons of onions are rotting, representing a loss of £500,000. Meanwhile, Dutch ships have been unloading cargoes of onions at King's Lynn.

</p>, <p>(iii.) Cost of Aircraft.—The Comptroller and Auditor General's duty is to see that public money is spent in accordance with the decisions of Parliament. What he reveals about the transactions of the Ministry of Civil Aviation makes sorry reading—aircraft specially ordered and soon afterwards sold for less than one-eighth of their cost. German planes reconditioned at a cost of over £10,000 each, only to be hired out at £20 a month and then after a few months' use, taken out of service. Lancastrians priced at £42,000 but sold at £14,000; Yorks priced at £50 000, sold outright at £17,500. If a commercial concern did its business on these lines it would soon be bankrupt.

</p>, <p>(iv.) Algerian Wine.—Mr. Strachey is left with 3,000,000 bottles of Algerian wine for which he can find no market. Cost to the taxpayer, £1,000,000.

</p>, <p>(v.) Entertaining.—Government guests are entertained at a cost to the taxpayers of £12 per head per night.

</p>, <p>These are just a few of innumerable examples. Taken individually, they may seem small, but in the aggregate they amount to a considerable total, for fresh examples come to light every day.

</p>, <p>Of no lesser importance is the cost of maintaining the enormous staffs of Central Government, which, excluding the Post Office, employs nearly half-a-million non-industrial Civil servants. Local authority staffs, too, have increased by 50 per cent. since the war. The administrative staffs of the nationalised industries seem to be growing with similar rapidity. Fewer licences and permits would release some of these workers, and this in turn would mean less Government expenditure and hence lower taxation.

</p>, <p>5. Position of Liberals.—Viscount Simon, who spoke for the Conservative candidate at the Epsom by-election and for many others since, is in strong disagreement with Mr. Clement Davies. Viscount Simon advises all Liberals to vote Tory. So does another prominent Liberal, Mr. Clive Bell, who wrote to this effect in the “Spectator” on October 22, 1948.

</p>, <p>I trust, Sir, that this provides “further information” required by your correspondent, Mr. Marsh. Lack of space prohibits a fuller explanation.—Yours faithfully.

</p>, <p palign="right">74, Spital-street. Dartford. <span class="page">[end p3]</span>
</p>, <p></p>, <p class="nonmt">Dear Sir,—The most significant aspect of the letter in your columns last week by Miss Roberts was that her letter, while long, omitted to deal with several important points raised. Possibly this was due to lack of space, but in view of the importance and interest of the matters raised I must ask her, once again, to deal with the vital questions.

</p>, <p>Fuel Crisis—(a) Miss Roberts claims that lack of generating plant had nothing to do with the loss of £200,000,000 of exports in the winter of 1946–7. In that case why was there a shedding of loads, severely reducing production in factories and necessitating the introduction of night shifts on a large scale? (b) In quoting the figures of wage-earners and coal output for 1941 under a “Tory dominated Government,” would it be unkind to ask Miss Roberts also to give the much more revealing statistics for 1944 and those for 1945, when the Labour Government came into office?

</p>, <p>National Health Bill—I cannot accept Miss Robert's reasons why her party voted against this Bill with such undisguised hostility. To deal with one of many, does she really feel that the voluntary hospitals were better off in the days when they had to beg in the streets for the funds to continue their great work than they are now?

</p>, <p>Food Subsidies—As Miss Roberts states, a remarkable admission, that she does not advocate reductions, I take it that she favours their retention. Is she aware that this is not in line with statements by many leading Tory politicians and that the automatic choice for Chancellor of the Exchequer in a Tory Government refers to them as a “running sore” ? On reflection, does she not think that she is in the wrong party?

</p>, <p>Liberals—Is Miss Roberts serious in her suggestion that the advice of Viscount Simon, who is generally known as a Liberal National and only a very short step removed from a Tory, should be preferred to that of the leader of the Liberal Party in the House of Commons in that it is wrong for a Liberal to vote Tory?—

<span class="comment"><i>Erith Observer</i>, 3 June 1949</span> </p>, <p class="nonmt">Dear Sir,—Further to your correspondent, Mr. Richard Marsh.

</p>, <p>1. Fuel Crisis: (a) To claim that the greater part of our exports were lost through lack of power (which Mr. Marsh attributed to lack of generating plant) is to put cause and effect the wrong way round. Many generating plants up and down the country could not work to their full capacity because of lack of coal. Had the coal been there in sufficient quantity the power generated by existing plant would have been adequate. The <i>cause</i> of the crisis was lack of <i>coal</i>, the <i>effect</i> was lack of <i>power</i>. (b) I am asked to give the “revealing statistics” of coal output for 1944 and 1945, “when the Labour Government came into office.” They are: 1944, 185,469,000 tons, 1945, 182,658,000. These statistics certainly reveal that coal production reached a new low level the year the Socialist Government took over.

</p>, <p>2. National Health Bill: Do I feel that the voluntary hospitals were better off in the days when they had to “beg in the streets” for funds? I do suggest that there are a number of voluntary hospitals which were very much better off under the old system, both financially and from the viewpoint of personal and local interest. Plans made by voluntary hospitals which were in a sound financial position have now been held in abeyance by cuts in capital expenditure imposed by the Ministry of Health. The Tories did fight certain parts of the Health Bill with vigour, notably those concerning the poor terms for doctors. Was not the Doctors v. Bevan fight also fought with “undisguised hostility,” and did not Bevan have to give in?

</p>, <p>3. Food Subsidies: I am not aware that there is any one person in the Tory Party who, as Mr. Marsh suggests, would be the “automatic choice for the Chancellor of the Exchequer in a Tory Government.” I personally would have narrowed the choice down to two, and the one I would fancy as the favourite is one who belongs to the very large section of the Tory party which, under the present economic situation, is in favour of not increasing the price of essential foods. As my own view happens to be in line with the majority of my party, I see no reason to change my political colour.

</p>, <p>4. Liberals: Viscount Simon is indeed a Liberal National, and in Mr. Marsh 's words “only a very short step removed from a Tory.” Therefore, we have it on Mr. Marsh 's authority that there is a kind of Liberal who is “only a short step removed from a Tory,” and who one would consequently expect to vote Tory!

</p>, <p>Further, your correspondent completely ignored my second example of Mr. Clive Bell, a well-known writer, and an ex-chairman of the St. Pancras Liberal Association. Not a National Liberal, just another Liberal recommending his fellows to vote Tory.

</p>, <p>Finally, I do not suggest that any Liberal should vote one way or the other solely on the advice of one of his own party. It is for every Liberal to study closely the principles of his own party and see whether, in his opinion, they fit in better with Conservatism or Socialism, and then to cast his vote accordingly.—Yours faithfully,

        </p>][<p id="section">Speeches, Interviews &amp; Other Statements</p>, <p id="description">Complete list of 8,000+ Thatcher statements &amp; texts of many of them</p>, <p class="nonmt">Miss Margaret Roberts, prospective Conservative Parliamentary candidate for Dartford constituency (of which Erith is a part) has had little chance since she was adopted to meet her supporters, because she has been working as a research chemist at Manningtree, and living at Colchester. She has now taken a new job in London, and will live at Dartford. This will vastly reduce travelling, and will enable her to attend more evening meetings, as she will be near her home.

</p>, <p>Between her two jobs Miss Roberts has had a short holiday, and has been able to meet Tory women at afternoon meetings. On Thursday, last week, she received an enthusiastic reception when she addresed as women's rally at the Carlton Hall, Erith, organized by the Women's Advisory Council of Kent Conservative Association (Dartford Division). In the chair was Mrs. D. M. Fletcher (chairman, Advisory Council), Mrs. A. C. Garrett and Mrs. A. Jenns (both vice-chairmen of the Council) and Mrs. Young (chairman, North Heath Women's Branch). More than 250 women were present.

</p>, <p>Women's inherent knowledge of human relationships was one of the subjects of Miss Roberts' talk. “Women have a special bent as technicians in human relationships,” she said, “and we have come to understand the human aspect of our problems. The problems we face to-day are not only ones of raw materials and money, but problems concerning human beings in our factories—problems of how to fit people in the jobs they want to do, so they can give their best.” 

</p>, <p>She continued: “Perhaps one of the greatest problems women face to-day is the difficulty of getting enough food (Cries of “hear, hear.” ) There is a whispering—in fact, a shouting campaign in operation—that if the Tories get back they will take off all the controls, but this is untrue. It was the Tories who introduced the finest food rationing system during the war. The only difference was that we got more food then.” 

</p>, <p>Meat, a question in the minds of all housewives at the moment, was another topic which was dealt with by Miss Roberts. Industrial production, she said, would be much greater if the workers could get more meat. She complained of the low production of home-produced beef, and sharply criticized the Government's delay in importing cattle feeding stuffs. “Pig production during 1948 was only half that of 1945. I cannot think that that would have happened if we had a competent Minister of Food,” she said.

</p>, <p> “The Dominions are very loyally coming to our rescue. Australia is planning to increase her meat production; South Africa is embarking on large development schemes, but those schemes all take some time for fruition. Canada has got a large production of things we need, but the Canadians say that instead of trading with them Britain is trading with Russia and countries behind the ‘iron curtain.’ We (the Conservatives) think our first duty is to stand behind the Empire.” <span class="page">[end p1]</span>
</p>, <p>
<span class="comment">(2) <i>Erith Observer</i>, 17 June 1949:</span> </p>, <p class="nonmt">The prospective Conservative candidate for the Dartford Division, Miss Margaret Roberts, B.A., B.Sc., addressed 200 women at the Carlton Hall, Erith, on Thursday afternoon last week.

</p>, <p>Miss Roberts said that looking back over the past half-century there had been a great change and development in women's interest in politics, and that they now played a large part in the national life outside the sphere of the home.

</p>, <p>In response to her call, the audience twice reaffirmed their belief in Imperial Preference.

</p>, <p>The organisation of the meeting was by Dartford Divisional Conservative Women's Advisory Committee, and Mrs. D. M. Fletcher presided. Also on the platform were Mrs. A. Jenns (vice-president). Mrs. A. C. Garrett (vice-president), Mrs. A. E. Young (Northumberland Heath Ward) and Mr. R. W. Mills (agent).

</p>, <p>Miss Roberts said at the outset that unless women managed to attend evening meetings she had few opportunities to meet them, so that she was glad they had attended that afternoon gathering. If they met her in the street they should stop her for a chat, and in that way she would get to know members personally.

</p>, <p>During the last war she said, this country had mobilised women to a far greater extent than any other in the world. They had gone to work, not only in ordinary jobs, but had also entered the professions. Women had contributed a great deal to the professions they had taken up.

</p>, <p>Household problems concerned women, yet 50 years ago they had no part in the planning of houses or in the large scale buying of food. But it was a restriction that household problems to-day took up such a great deal of women's time, because of the difficulty of getting commodities.

</p>, <p>Conservatives absolutely refuted the contention of a Socialist Minister that Whitehall officials knew better than the people what was good for them. “We have no truck with such a belief.” said Miss Roberts.

</p>, <p>A whispering campaign, alleging that Conservatives would remove controls if returned to power, was taking place. When Lord Woolton was Food Minister, she recalled, a Conservative-dominated government instituted the finest rationing system in the world. The only difference was that people received more then than now.

</p>, <p>Opponents asserted that Lord Woolton had lease-lend, but only 14.3 per cent. of that was spent on food, and the European markets were closed. The Labour Government had, first, the American loan and now Marshall Aid, and the Continental markets were open again.

</p>, <p>Turning to the meat situation, the candidate said many women, especially in working class families, went without meat and gave it to their husbands. Britain was to-day producing only two-thirds of the pre-war beef output.

</p>, <p>One solution was to use some of the few dollars that Britain had on livestock feeding stuffs instead of on meat. If £1,000 of feeding stuff was imported it would save £2,000 of imported livestock, she said.

</p>, <p>Countries in Europe which had followed that system were among the first to recover, yet 18 months were lost before the Government spent dollars on livestock feeding materials.

</p>, <p>In 1948 pig production was not only lower than before the war, but was indeed 55 per cent. lower than in 1945, declared Miss Roberts. It had, then, fallen by almost half in three years.

</p>, <p>Development schemes and other methods to increase the meat supplies to this country were being explored in the Dominions. The Dominions had stood by the Mother Country during the war, and were coming to Britain's aid again.

</p>, <p>Questions on women's problems were answered by Miss Roberts who was thanked by Mrs. Garrett and Mrs. Jenns.

</p>, <p>An invitation to women to join the association was given by Mrs. Fletcher.</p>, <p>Copyright © Margaret Thatcher Foundation 2018. All Rights Reserved.

Where they cannot de-nationalise, they will de-centralise.

</p>, <p>This was stated by Mr. Anthony Eden, M.C., M.P., who spoke at the Kent County Conservative Rally at Dartford Football Ground on Saturday.

</p>, <p>When Miss Margaret Roberts, B.A., B.Sc., prospective candidate for Dartford Division, described Mr. Eden as “a great man, great not only in our time, but great in all time,” there was an outburst of cheering.

</p>, <p>Mr. Charles Knight, hon. secretary, Kent County Organisation, and organiser of the rally, told the “Kentish Times” that he was pleased with the attendance, “when one considers that the rally was held in a most hostile part of the county.” 

</p>, <p>Community singing was led by Mr. Arthur Caiger, D.C.M., and music was played by Callender's Band.

</p>, <p>The chairman, Mr. A. C. Bossom, M.P. (Maidstone) said he believed everyone in Great Britain to-day was a little worried. At the moment they were being placed in a very serious situation. They were being told by the Prime Minister that they were facing a serious crisis— “<i>another</i> serious crisis.” This time it was a financial and economic one. They were told they must work harder and produce more. Yet they found that the increased cost of living and taxes took away everything extra that they earned.

</p>, <p>They were told they had to save. More money was being taken out of National Savings than was going in. The Government was spending money with a reckless lack of control that was quite abnormal.

</p>, <p> “We are all tremendously proud of the officers and men of H.M.S. Amethyst,” said the chairman. “But this gallant effort would not have been needed if it had not been for the great onrush of the Communists through China. Month by month they are getting nearer to Hong Kong, Malaya, Burma—and even to India itself.” 

</p>, <p>The Government said, “More nationalisation.” Could any of those present buy coal as cheaply as before the Government took charge of it? Could they buy a railway ticket as cheaply?

</p>, <p>It had been said that the Conservative Party had no leaders—what about Mr. Churchill? It was he, and others with him, who played a vital part in enabling us to win the greatest war of all time.

</p>, <p>Mr. Bossom adjured his audience not to forget that whether the General Election came in autumn or Spring, it was coming swiftly upon the parties. The question to be decided was whether they wanted to continue under the direction of the present group or whether they wanted to be led by men of sound common sense.

</p>, <p>Introducing Mr. Eden, the chairman said:

</p>, <p> “We Conservatives have the most respected Deputy Leader we have ever had in this country. His vast ability has stood up to every test. He is a man who stands for all of Britain, and when he speaks he speaks for Britain. He is one of the finest men in the world.” 

</p>, <p>Mr. Eden prefaced his speech with a reference to the “gallant and brilliantly successful exploit” of the Amethyst and expressed his disgust at comments made in the “Daily Worker,” “who thought it necessary to dim the brilliance of this venture by publishing a report that the Amethyst fired on and sank a Chinese passenger liner, and while soldiers tried to rescue the drowning passengers, sailed away.” 

</p>, <p>No-one who knew the Royal Navy could believe it for a single instant. How base it was that anyone in this country could publish reports like that!

</p>, <p>A fortnight ago (said Mr. Eden) the Conservative Party set out the view of the action which this country should take to meet its present and future difficulties. That policy was called “The Right Road for Britain,” and was introduced by Mr. Churchill at Wolverhampton. Wide interest among supporters and opponents had been aroused by the document.

</p>, <p>The chief criticism brought against the Conservative Party by the Socialists was that their policy (they said) was dishonest. “By this, apparently, they mean that the improvement in our national affairs which we seek to bring about by our policies is unrealisable in view of the present state of the nation. Well, I will admit that if the present grave deterioration of our economic and financial affairs is allowed to continue unchecked at the present rate, no one can foresee what the future may hold.” 

</p>, <p> “The Prime Minister accuses us of vote-catching. At least we have never attempted, either in our speeches or in this statement of policy, to belittle the gravity of our dangers. We have stated the stark facts as they are,” said the speaker.

</p>, <p>Mr. Eden then quoted from the party's document: “First we must earn our own livelihood. Unless we can sell our products in foreign markets at competitive prices, we shall suffer unemployment and will not be able to sustain our standard of living or our social services. Until we re-establish once again our economic independence, our way of life and the possibility of defending it will remain precarious.” 

</p>, <p>Since the document was in proof, Sir Stafford Cripps had said that the estimates of his own White Paper, published only four months before, had been falsified, and that the drain on our gold and dollar reserves in the first half of this year, which had been estimated at £195,000,000, had in fact amounted to £237,000,000, reducing our total gold reserves to a little over £100,000,000.

</p>, <p>In the course of the debate he (Mr. Eden) told the Chancellor that his summing-up of the situation had been too optimistie. Whatever charges could be levelled against the Conservatives nobody could pretend that they had not uttered repeated warnings of the dangers that confronted us, he claimed.

</p>, <p> “The Government are very difficult to please in this respect,” said Mr. Eden. “If we paint the picture in the dark colours in which we see it, we are accused of being gloomy prophets of woe. If we show, as we have done in ‘The Right Road for Britain,’ the goal towards which we want to work then we are told that we are vote-catching.” 

</p>, <p>As a nation they were not to-day living within their means. Nor were they paying their way. In two world wars they spent the greater part of the savings which their ancestors had accumulated and invested overseas. To meet their immediate difficulties, their American friends were assisting them with loans and with Marshall Aid Nothing could surpass the generosity shown to them by Canada and other overseas Dominions. They could not continue indefinitely to live on the help of others. They had to stand on their own feet—and do so soon. Moreover, this Marshall Aid from America was scheduled to diminish year by year until 1952.

</p>, <p>The expectation was that in the meanwhile their overseas balance of payments would gradually be rectified, so that when Marshall Aid was exhausted they could stand on their own feet. Their gold reserves were continuing to melt away, despite Marshall Aid.

</p>, <p> “What is so disturbing,” said Mr. Eden, “is that we are now confronted with a situation where even Marshall Aid has not stopped or checked the drain on our gold reserves upon which our solvency depends, and in the meanwhile we know that we have urgently to make ready for a day when we shall have to do without it. I fear that we may be further away from that position than we were a year ago.” 

</p>, <p>It was impossible to deny that the consequences of nationalisation had nearly every time been higher costs. Was it not remarkable that coal prices had risen much more sharply than steel prices? It was a fact that they were still producing steel in this country under free enterprise—and having to pay increased coal prices—more cheaply than anywhere else in Europe or America. Did it not seem extraordinary that in the light of that successful record the Government should still persist? “Doctrinaire Socialism has to have its way whatever the cost,” commented Mr. Eden.

</p>, <p>On the new proposals by the Socialists to nationalise insurance companies Mr. Eden said the whole of the activities of companies would be taken over. Figures had been given which shewed that overseas earnings from insurance business in an average year exceeded £30,000,000. The industry brought to them a nett gain of dollars. What folly it was to jeopardise any part of these earnings at a time when overseas connections formed an important part of their business.

</p>, <p> “Once a part of our insurance industry is nationalised, a blow will undoubtedly be struck at the earning capacity in foreign lands of that industry as a whole,” declared the speaker.

</p>, <p>In a recent reply to Mr. Churchill, the Prime Minister had claimed that the social services of this country, if not in all cases directly due to the Labour Party, had come about as a result of Labour Party pressure. “We all know that is not true,” said Mr. Eden. “Everybody knows that the process has been a progressive one for the last 50 years at least. It is a process in which Liberal and Conservative Parliaments have both played a part.” 

</p>, <p>Everyone sincerely wished to maintain the bighest possible standard of social services for our people. Unless they were able to sell abroad in competition with other countries, unless they were able to balance their accounts, sooner or later the day of reckoning had to come. They had been consuming their capital assets at a great rate ( “We have sold the Argentine Railways, and we are eating them!” ) Very high taxation meant that the Government's revenue would flually be subjected to the law of diminishing returns.

</p>, <p>The Prime Minister (said Mr. Eden) had also spoken of the progress made in respect of agricultural production. No bouquets could be extended to the Government. On the contrary, there was only too much reason to fear that the Government had failed to strike a proper and practical balance in the programme of agricultural expansion to meet the country's urgent needs. They had declined to spend any dollars on feeding stuffs. Half the pigsties were empty and people were still confined to a miserably small meat ration, so exignous as to be almost invisible. Certainly their present circumstances demanded that they should grow more grain than before the war, but any practical man could have told the Government that a proper balance had to be kept between livestock and corn-growing. But, of course, the Government was always too late in listening to practical men.

</p>, <p>In their policy the Conservative Party had given considerable attention to the horticultural position. They considered that “the market gardener and fruit grower have to bear the same additional costs for wages and equipment as does the farmer who gets a guaranteed price, and they are entitled to stability and safe-guards against unfair competition.” 

</p>, <p>Mr. Attlee had been very indignant at Mr. Churchill 's comparison between the recovery they had made in this country and the recovery made by other countries of Western Europe. It was the constant boast of the Socialist Government that they were the best Government in Europe. Others would perhaps be forgiven if they did not take quite the same view.

</p>, <p>Comparing industrial production to-day with that of 1937, Norway, Holland and Denmark had all forged further ahead than we had while France was on a par with us.

</p>, <p>If a fair balance were taken, it was true (continued Mr. Eden) that these countries had reached a point at least equal to ours in the restoration of pre-war production. In face of these facts how could the Prime Minister claim that we led those countries in production increase, or accuse Mr. Churchill of misrepresentation?

</p>, <p>Nobody could wish to belittle the efforts of all engaged in British industry. The record of the export industries in particular had been remarkable. And let it be noted that nine-tenths of it or more was the record of free enterprise industry.

</p>, <p> “I have only one other comment to make on the Prime Minister's speech,” said Mr. Eden. “<i>The Times</i> and other newspapers report that he caused much amusement by imitating Mr. Churchill 's method of delivery. I am sorry the Prime Minister should have done that. On reflection, I expect the Prime Minister will be rather sorry, too. It was rather a cheap joke. don't you think?

</p>, <p> “After all, that voice has been an inspiration to millions in our country's darkest and finest hour. And not in our country only. Throughout occupied Europe during all those war years whole nations listened for that voice. It gave them hope and strength where there was no hope otherwise, and they will never forget it. All that is part of recorded history which no man can change. It seems a pity that Mr. Churchill 's successor as Prime Minister should try to reduce it all to the level of a rather cheap music hall joke.” 

</p>, <p>Mr. Eden continued: “Socialism. I am sure, is the wrong road. Nationalisation, yet more nationalisation—that is the Socialist Party's constant remedy for all ills. More Government control, higher costs, heavier taxation—that way disaster lies.

</p>, <p> “We are often asked what we will do if we get back into power. We will at once cry a halt to all further schemes of nationalisation. If the Iron and Steel Bill is then on the Statute Book, we will repeal it and set that industry free. Where we cannot de-nationalise, we will de-centralise.” 

</p>, <p>Mr. Eden asked for the voters' endorsement of the party's opinions, because the party believed that only those opinions could make and keep the country safe. They lived in serious times. In some measure the real seriousness was veiled by Marshall Aid.

</p>, <p> “If we return to power,” the Deputy Leader concluded, “we shall do everything we can to help to build up the prosperity and strength of this country and the Empire which we are proud to serve.” 

</p>, <p>After Mr. Eden 's speech, which ended in waves of applause, it was announced that £445 13s. 6d. had been collected from the audience in the ground. (Later, this was made up to £500.)

</p>, <p>Proposing a vote of thanks, Miss Margaret Roberts said: “We are proud and happy to welcome a great man, great not only in our time, but great in all time.” 

</p>, <p>The audience that afternoon had come there to learn, quite seriously about the policy of the party, not for any frivolous reason, such as the hope of seeing a helicopter land out of the sky (Laughter). The issues facing the voters were these: “Do you or do you not want any more nationalisation?” and “Do you want our finances put on a sound basis or to go downhill to bankruptcy?” 

</p>, <p>Mr. John Brooks, prospective candidate for Faversham, seconded the vote of thanks.

</p>, <p>Miss Patricia Hornsby-Smith, prospective candidate for Chislehurst, said how proud she was that the rally was being held on the bounds of Chislehurst territory.

</p>, <p>On the platform, in addition to those mentioned, were Lord De L'Isle and Dudley, V.C. (joint hon. treasurer of the Party). Viscount Allenby (vice-chairman of South Eastern Provincial Area), Sir Waldron Smithers, J.P., M.P. (Orpington), Mr. J. Baker White, M.P. (Canterbury), Brigadier H. R. Mackeson, M.P.

</p>, <p>Describing it as a quality not very much in evidence at the moment, she went on: “In war-time there was a slogan, ‘It all depends on me.’ People seem to have forgotten that, and they think it depends on the other person. I suggest that the Young Conservatives bring back the slogan, because unless each one of us does our bit to put the country on its feet no one else will.” 

</p>, <p>She congratulated them on the idea of holding a fete and carrying it out so well. In these times so many young people seemed to do nothing but wait for someone else to do things, and to expect to have everything brought to them. She was glad the Young Conservatives were getting up and doing something themselves, and showing the youth of the country the way they must go.

</p>, <p>They would have to work doubly hard, but they gave their services with gratitude and were glad they had a share. The younger generation were going on to take office when some of the older people had to relinquish it. The older people had done a great deal for the party in the past, and it was time the younger ones took a greater part in the work to be done.

</p>, <p>Continuing Miss Roberts said people of her generation had had rather a raw deal in the post-war world. When they were ready to go along the road to their careers they were faced with the Direction of Labour Order and more restrictions than any other generation had had to face in this country. Those who were young and had talent wanted to go ahead and get rid of these restrictions and help themselves and their country.

</p>, <p>Dartford Young Conservatives she described as second to none in the country. They had a membership of more than 100, which was a splendid record. Once they saw a Conservative Government in power they and all Young Conservatives up and down the country would be able to say with Keats. “Bliss was it in that dawn to be alive, but to be young was very heaven.” 

</p>, <p>Mr. G. Waterman (chairman of the Dartford branch of the Young Conservatives), who presided, told all young people who were not quite sure what they felt about politics that the Young Conservatives could give them their particular answer on Tuesday evenings at the Conservative Club at 8. He assured them that this was by no means a polite gathering, so if they had any criticisms “of anything under the sun.” and were between 15 and 30, they could go along and air them. He thanked Mr. and Mrs. Pottle for the use of the garden.

</p>, <p>In thinking Miss Roberts, Miss Mary Hamilton (chairman of the Dartford Division of Young Conservatives) said that united they could do a great deal.

</p>, <p>Bouquets to Miss Roberts and Mrs. Pottle were presented by Christina Byrne and Christine Strong.

</p>, <p>Mr. J. L. Miller (chairman of the Dartford Division of the Conservative Association) was among those present.

</p>, <p>The fete was the first venture of its kind to be run by the branch.

</p>, <p>Stalls and stall-holders were: Household, Miss M. Pottle and Miss A. Garner: fancy, Miss P. Emmens: ices and minerals, Miss M. Rohan and Miss M. Belsev: fruit and vegetables. Mr. R. Jackson. Side-shows: Treasure hunt, Miss K. Jarvis: bagatelle, Mr. J. Stedman; rolling the penny, Miss J. Hitch: roulette. Derek Wilkinson.

</p>, <p>Teas and refreshments were served by Miss M. Hamilton, Mrs. Essex, Mrs. Stevens and Mrs. Summers.

</p>, <p>Mr. J. Summers acted as treasurer for the fete. A whist drive concluded the evening.

</p>, <p> “Many of us women are dissatisfied with the present Government, so this time we will apply it to them,” she said.

</p>, <p>Miss Roberts, who was speaking at a garden fete organised by the branch at Broomfields, Wilmington, said that like every other political party, the Conservatives looked to the women to produce the goods, and so far in this constituency they had never failed.

</p>, <p>There were one million more women voters on the electoral roll than men, and women now held the whip-hand. Their vote was won for them by their ancestors by a great deal of effort, and it was up to them to use it as conscientiously—and even more so—than any other member of the community.

</p>, <p>Women had a different approach to politics from men. They had no time to read their newspaper as diligently as they would like, especially when they had to get out and get something for dinner—before someone else got it! But they saw everything at first-hand and were more realists in any political situation than men were. They had a great contribution to offer.

</p>, <p>It was no use a politician getting up and saying, “We have built a million houses. The housing problem is solved,” when their next-door neighbour had been on the waiting list for three years and had still not got a house.

</p>, <p>The women in the Dartford Division exerted their responsibilities to the full. They did not leave things to the other person, and once again she wanted to emphasise the note of personal responsibility. Anything which the State gave them—and they were not against State assistance—was only to help with their responsibilities towards their families and not to relieve them of those responsibilities, as so many people seemed to think today. They did not want their children to become children of the State.

</p>, <p>They knew very well of lots of family allowances which the children could do with which did not go to them at all. There was a breach of faith with the principle for which family allowances were meant, she thought.

</p>, <p>There was bickering between Parties at the moment as to who was responsible for family allowances, but she had never yet heard the name of the woman who originally suggested it. This was Eleanor Rathbone who came from her own college.

</p>, <p>They were apt to think that because they worked hard and conscientiously all women did the same. But they must remember that there were women who ill-treated their children, and they should propagate their own principles to their neighbours and the coming generation.

</p>, <p>They in the Conservative Party believed greatly in family life, and they would do all they could to keep that belief alive and fight anything that tended to shatter it.

</p>, <p>Miss Roberts thanked Mrs. B. E. Waterman for the loan of her garden, Mrs. A. Jenns (who presided), Mrs. Fletcher and helpers.

</p>, <p>In thanking Miss Roberts, Mrs. Jenns mentioned that she (Miss Roberts) had arranged to work on Saturday afternoon in order to attend their fete at mid-week.

</p>, <p>On behalf of the branch, Ann Walsh presented Miss Roberts with a box of chocolates and a bottle of eau-de-cologne.</p>, <p>Copyright © Margaret Thatcher Foundation 2018. All Rights Reserved.

E. Brittenden, president of the Orpington Divisional Association, at Green-Street-Green, on Saturday.

</p>, <p>She told representatives of Orpington and district, Petts Wood, Biggin Hill, Eynsford and Farningham branches that the fifth freedom should be freedom to use one's talents as one wished and to develop one's own ideas.

</p>, <p>Miss Roberts considered the next General Election would be fought on both the immediate problem of the financial position and on the fundamental issue of nationalisation versus private ownership. She had believed two or three months ago that there would not be an autumn election; now she was not so sure, for the financial position was such that the Government might find they could not cope with it and hold a snap election.

</p>, <p> “If you went home to-day and heard the news on the radio that the writ for an election had been issued, are you ready for it?” asked Miss Roberts. “If you are not, I ask you to use the remaining few weeks to get ready and prepared so that when you hear the news you will know what to do.” 

</p>, <p>Miss Roberts devoted most of her address to the issue between nationalisation and a property-owning democracy. Speaking of the consequences of nationalisation, she said it was termed public ownership, the public were supposed to own a little bit of the nationalised industries, Ownership, meant that one had some control over what they owned, but the public did not own the nationalised industries in that sense, as could be seen from what had happened on the railways and the coalmines. If a question about them was asked in Parliament, the Minister need not answer it on the grounds that it was a day-to-day matter of administration, and when the prices were put up there was nothing the public could do about it. Public ownership was a myth, for the public had no control over the industries or any say in the running of them.

</p>, <p>It was the Minister concerned who had all the power, for he appointed the boards to run the industries; he had absolute power. History had turned the full circle, and now power was back in the hands of the few. This must not go on, for it meant slipping back 1,000 years in history.

</p>, <p> “We Conservatives want power more widely diffused through private ownership, so that you never get more power in the hands of the Government than you get in the hands of the people. Ownership that you and I have must always be greater than the ownership of the Government for that is the only check we have on Government activity. When we have men in power as we have to-day who say, ‘We are the masters now,’ you may be certain they will not use that power as judiciously as they should in a democratic country. Those words would never have fallen from Conservative lips, for we knew that power is placed in our hands as a responsibility and the people are masters. As long as free elections are held in this country the people are the masters, but people like those in power to-day will never give up power. The longer they hold it the more difficult it will be to get it away from them.” 

</p>, <p>Under nationalisation, a man with ideas could not develop them his own way, it was not creative. The country needed uncommon men, the men with ideas but they would be stifled under nationalisation and the common man would be worse off, too, for if he lost his job in a State-controlled industry he would not he able to find an outlet for his particular skill with another firm, for the State would control all that industry.

</p>, <p>The Conservatives believed in the four freedoms of the Atlantic Charter, but they also wanted a fifth—freedom for everyone to use their talents and develop their ideas. It was difficult to put down these ideals of freedom on paper or in speech and get them over to the people, and it was easy to be cynical about them. Communism had nothing in common with them, but Conservatives had and Miss Roberts hoped that they would go on fighting until they were secure in this country, the Empire and the world.

</p>, <p>Replying to questions, Miss Roberts said not one social service had been originated by the Socialist Government; all they had done was to “put the roof on” foundations laid by others. The Socialists said these services would not have come had they not pressed for them, but the Conservatives were going about social reform long before the Labour movement even started. Family allowances were the idea of a woman, Eleanor Rathbone, who was perhaps the greatest woman M.P. of all time, and she hoped that the women of the country would see to it that she got the credit for it.

</p>, <p>Mr. J. Bacon, chairman of Petts Wood Young Conservatives presided, and Mr. W. Boulton, Biggin Hill, thanked Miss Roberts and Mr. and Mrs. J. E. Brittenden for the loan of their garden.

</p>, <p>Among those present were Sir Waldron Smithers, M.P., J.P., Major P. W. Twyman (Divisional chairman) and Mrs. Twyman, Mr. and Mrs. Brittenden and Mr. Charles Knight (Divisional agent).

<span class="comment"><i>Dartford Chronicle</i>, 2 September 1949:</span> </p>, <p class="mt">Dear Sir,—Here is the information which Mr. Norman Dodds requested me to give in his letter published your last issue.

</p>, <p>(a) The Government's plan for direction of labour was issued by the <span class="nm">George Isaacs</span>Minister of Labour as the Control of Engagement Order on September 18, 1947, and was to have expired on January 1, 1949. The period has been extended to January 1, 1950, by Statutory Instrument No. 2608, 1948, according to the Ministry of Labour Committee.

</p>, <p>The Minister of Labour was acting in exercise of his powers of legislation by decree, conferred on him under the Supplies and Services (Extended Purposes) Act, 1947. Such delegated legislation is not subject to amendment by Parliament.

</p>, <p>(b) The number of persons who have been formally directed by the Order are as follows: Between October, 1947, and December, 1948, 29; during the first six months of this year, 66; making a sum total of 95. Comment on the significance of these figures will be reserved until after (c).

</p>, <p>(c) The Order applies to all men aged 18 to 50 and to all women aged 18 to 40, except under the following circumstances: (i) Women having a child of under 15 years; (ii) ex-Service personnel during paid resettlement leave; (iii) those engaged in dock work or the employed in a managerial, professional, administrative or executive capacity.

</p>, <p>The Order compels employees seeking workers and workers seeking employment to use employment exchanges. Unemployed persons who, after having been offered a choice of jobs, refuse to accept essential work, will be given 14 days to think it over. If they still refuse, they are liable to be directed.

</p>, <p>For further details on this point I would refer readers to Statutory Rules and Orders No. 2021, 1947, and to the accompanying “Quiz” leaflet issued by the Ministry of Labour to explain the operation of the Order.

</p>, <p>Comment: The small number of cases in which compulsion has had to be applied is often acclaimed by the Socialists. The figures considered alone are misleading. It must not be forgotten that they relate only to the formal directions which the Ministry issues as a last resort. The majority of people, when threatened with direction, “go quietly;” but it is the existence of these powers which causes them to go. Such persons are in fact, though not in law, directed, and they are far more numerous than the hardy spirits who hold out until compelled to give in.

</p>, <p>If the above figure, 95, gave a true picture of the amount of control exercised, then clearly the Order is not worth, retaining for such a few. One is therefore driven to the conclusion that the Government considers the very existence of the Order operates a large amount of control.

</p>, <p>Not all Socialists agree with the Order. On November 3, 1947, there was a Socialist motion to annul it. The motion was unfortunately lost. Mr. Dodds was one of those who voted for the <i>retention</i> of the Order.

</p>, <p>(d) Less than 72 hours before I spoke to the Young Conservatives, my attention was drawn to a case of a person who was negotiating direct with another employer for a better job. He was informed that such action was prohibited under the Order, that he would require to secure his release from his present employment and apply through a labour exchange. There was then no guarantee that the exchange would send him to the job he wanted, but they might direct him to another. He considered the risk of not getting the post too great, and is still in his present work.

</p>, <p>While it may be argued that that person was not legally prevented from taking the new job (though he may have been had he chosen to have gone through with it), the fact remains that owing to the existence of the Control of Engagement Order and the wide powers of direction held by the Minister of Labour, he is now one rung lower on the ladder than he would otherwise have been. This is only one instance. I could cite others of a similar nature.—Yours faithfully,

</p>, <p palign="centre">Margaret H. Roberts,

</p>, <p palign="centre">Prospective Conservative candidate, Dartford Division.

</p>, <p palign="centre">74, Spital-street, Dartford.

</p>, <p></p>, <p class="nonmt">Sir,—So Miss Margaret Roberts now admits that only 95 persons have been directed since October, 1947. Mr. Isaacs. Minister of Labour informs me that up to July 31, 1949, the official figures are 19 men and 10 women. Whichever figures are correct I think Miss Roberts will agree that her speech to the Young Conservatives could give an entirely different impression. But why on earth did Miss Roberts go to such great lengths in your columns last week to make out a case because it has absolutely nothing to do with the speech she made about a “raw deal” and the “Order interfering with the careers of young people.” If Miss Roberts will give a little thought to this important matter she will appreciate that the persons directed were all unemployed and that each person had turned down offers of employment through a Labour Exchange—surely Miss Roberts does not think that to be unemployed is a suitable “career” for a young person.

</p>, <p>However, in the closing sentences she does hint at a case of a young man who was prevented from bettering himself by the Order but the details as given by Miss Roberts are somewhat confused and I should be grateful if I could have further information to enable me to look into the case.

</p>, <p>It is most unfortunate for Miss Roberts that a few days ago (August 30) a well-known journalist and champion of the Liberal cause, writing in the <i>News-Chronicle</i>, had this to say about the Order: “In a world of increasingly tyrannical oppression, we remain a free people, resolute in our heritage, and healthily suspicious of all forms of compulsion however benevolently inspired. It was that healthy instinct which caused the Labour Government's measures for the direction of labour to become a dead letter.” —Yours faithfully,

</p>, <p palign="right">M.P., Dartford Division.

 <span class="comment"><i>Dartford Chronicle</i>, 16 September 1949:</span> </p>, <p class="mt">Dear Sir,—When this correspondence began, Mr. Dodds put four points to me concerning the Direction of Labour Order. They were answered one by one a week later.

</p>, <p>From his letter in last week's issue, it appears that Mr. Dodds has tried hard to skate round the comments made under (b) and (c) of my first reply. As they were both important and relevant, I must take this opportunity of reiterating them. The crux of the correspondence seems to be this: Mr. Dodds considers the direction figures issued to be an accurate measurement of the amount of control exercised by the Order. He therefore seems to agree with the “well-known journalist,” whom he quotes, that the Order is a “dead letter.” I do not concur with this view, as indicated in my letter of a fortnight ago. I therefore put the following points to Mr. Dodds:—

</p>, <p>(1) If the Order is a “dead letter,” why was it extended for a further year?

</p>, <p>(2) If he personally considers it a “dead letter,” would he be prepared to move its annulment forthwith?

</p>, <p>(3) If he refuses, then, on the “dead letter reasoning” set out in his own correspondence, it can only mean one of two things—either he wants to keep this control for control's sake or he agrees with me that the Order is not a “dead letter,” but a live wire.

</p>, <p>I should be very grateful if Mr. Dodds would give a little more thought to this important matter, and if he would clarify his position, explicitly, in the next instalment of this public “pen friendship.” —Yours faithfully,

</p>, <p palign="centre">Margaret H. Roberts,

</p>, <p palign="centre">Prospective Conservative candidate, Dartford Division.

</p>, <p palign="centre">74, Spital-street, Dartford. <span class="page">[end p2]</span>
</p>, <p></p>, <p class="nonmt">Dear Sir,—To my new found “pen friend” and your readers I give the two answers asked for: 1. In the sense that A. J. Cummings, the Liberal journalist, referred to the Order as a “dead letter,” my answer is—Yes; 2. As to my supporting a move to annul the Order it is—No.

</p>, <p>Mr. Cummings had in mind the rare occasions in which the Order has been invoked, and the Labour Government can be depended upon only to use it in the extreme cases where an individual cannot find employment and consistently refuses the offer of work.

</p>, <p>Miss Roberts will by now realise how misleading was her speech to the Young Conservatives, in which she referred to the “raw deal” and interference with the careers of young people as the result of the Order. If the Tory Party came to power much more effective methods would, as in the past, be used to “inspire” a section of the workers, and if Miss Roberts will attend my meeting at the Church Hall on September 30, not only will she receive some first hand information of what happened on Tyneside and Wearside between the two wars, but the opportunity would be given for us to make progress from a “pen friendship” to being on “speaking terms.” —Yours faithfully

<span class="comment"><i>Dartford Chronicle</i>, 30 September 1949:</span> </p>, <p class="mt">Dear Sir,—In order not to lose the thread of the argument in the correspondence between Mr. Dodds and myself, it would be advisable to have a “recap.” 

</p>, <p>First week.—Mr. Dodds asked me to give him some information on the Direction of Labour Order; including the number of directives issued.

</p>, <p>Second week.—I replied giving the desired figures, pointing out that they, were not an accurate measure of the amount of control exercised by the Order, as most people “went quietly” when threatened with direction.

</p>, <p>Third week.—Mr. Dodds blandly ignored this point and crashed on with his thesis that as the number of directives was very small, the Order was a “dead letter.” 

</p>, <p>Fourth week.—I repeated my former point and inquired why the Order was retained if it was a “dead letter.” I further asked Mr. Dodds if he would move its annulment.

</p>, <p>Fifth week.—Mr. Dodds replied that he considered it a “dead letter” only in the sense that the number of actual directives was small. He refused not only to move its annulment, but even to support anyone else's move to annul it.

</p>, <p>This week's instalment.—If the Order is a <i>dead</i> letter <i>only</i> as far as the actual directives are concerned, then it follows that it is very much <i>alive</i> as a threat which in itself is sufficient to control large sections of the population in the event of their wanting to change jobs. At last, therefore, Mr. Dodds has indirectly admitted the truth of what I pointed out to him in my first letter, namely, that the Order exercises far wider control than is indicated by the figures of actual directives. Otherwise why does he wish to retain it?

</p>, <p>If anything has been misleading since my original remark it is Mr. Dodds ' persistent efforts to skate round my point. His real attitude was only revealed when I challenged him to try and remove the order.

</p>, <p>Finally, sir, I shall have to decline Mr. Dodds ' invitation to his meeting, as I have two political engagements on that same evening. I feel sure another opportunity will occur in the near future for the “pen friendship” to develop from written to verbal lines.—Yours faithfully,

        </p>][<p id="section">Speeches, Interviews &amp; Other Statements</p>, <p id="description">Complete list of 8,000+ Thatcher statements &amp; texts of many of them</p>, <p>Dear Sir,—For the sake of accuracy, I feel it is most desirable that Miss Roberts should be more explicit than appears to be the case when she spoke on the important matter of family allowances at a Wilmington garden fete. According to the report in your columns, Miss Roberts, referring to the bickering as to which party was responsible for family allowances, said she “had never yet heard the name of the woman who suggested it. This was Eleanor Rathbone, etc.” 

</p>, <p>It is possible that some readers might have jumped to the conclusion that the splendid humanitarian woman M.P., now deceased, was a Tory. I can well remember some unkind things she said about the Tories from the Independent bench in the House. Would Miss Roberts explain why successive Tory governments, with their overwhelming majorities in a Britain much richer than it is to-day, never got past the talking stage?

</p>, <p>Miss Roberts is also reported as saying: “They (I presume this refers to the Tory women at the fete) knew very well of lots of family allowances which the children could do with which did not go to them at all.” Did Miss Roberts ever expect that there would not be such cases where millions are concerned, and does she suggest that to prevent abuse by a few family allowances should end? Or does she suggest that the Labour Government should introduce further measures designed to ensure that family allowances are not squandered by wayward mothers?—Yours faithfully,

<span class="comment"><i>Dartford Chronicle</i>, 9 September 1949</span> </p>, <p class="mt">Dear Sir,—In reply to Mr. Dodd 's letter on Family Allowances published last week:—

</p>, <p>Firstly, there was no suggestion at the Wilmington fete that Eleanor Rathbone was a Tory. Most of the audience were well aware that she was not. Had Mr. Dodds and his party been first to pay similar tribute to this wonderful woman, the Tories would have joined him in his act, gladly though in a rather more pleasant manner than he has chosen to adopt in this instance. He points out that she sat as an Independent Member. Let us be a little “more explicit” and add that from 1929 until her death she sat for one of the University seats (Combined English Universities), which the Socialists have now abolished.

</p>, <p>Secondly, although the Family Allowances Act did not receive Royal Assent until June, 1945, under the Conservative Caretaker Government a great deal of social legislation was passed by successive Tory Governments which prepared the way for the all-embracing social security plan that included family allowances.

</p>, <p>The Socialists have not always been staunch champions of family allowances. What did they do about introducing them during their period of office from 1929–31? Nothing, In fact, the Trades Union Congress turned down the idea of cash allowances in 1930 (see official report 1930 Congress p. 382–3). Further, the Socialist Party resisted an amendment to the Unemployment Insurance Bill of 1929 to increase the children's allowance from 2s. to 5s. In the Division which followed, 204 Socialists, led by Margaret Bondfield, then Minister of Labour, voted against the increase.

</p>, <p>Thirdly I do not suggest that Family Allowances should end, as Mr. Dodds seems anxious to infer, but I unhesitatingly condemn their abuse. Nor do I think that “further measures,” in the shape of legislation, would cure the trouble. The problem is not such that it can be resolved by the popular Socialist remedy of more and more legislation. It goes far deeper than that and will only be overcome when individual men and women have sufficient personal responsibility to perform the duties of democracy as eagerly as they accept its privileges.—Yours faithfully,

</p>, <p></p>, <p>Dear Sir,—While admiring the remarkable industry of Miss Margaret Roberts in her letters to your paper, may I point out that she has omitted to reply to the most important query contained in my previous letter, which was as follows: Would Miss Roberts explain why successive Tory Governments, with their overwhelming majorities in a Britain much richer than it is to-day, never got past the talking stage? Is it the opinion of Miss Roberts that the 17 years of undisputed power between the two wars was not long enough in which to get such a measure on the Statute Book?—Yours faithfully,

<span class="comment"><i>Dartford Chronicle</i>, 23 September 1949</span> </p>, <p class="nonmt">Dear Sir,—Mr. Dodds seems to be doing his best to cover up the Socialist Party's early opposition to cash family allowances by attacking the Tory Party for not introducing them earlier.

</p>, <p>While allowances were made to the families of widows and unemployed persons under successive Tory Governments, the principle of extending cash allowances to all children after the first was not universally accepted until the beginning of the present decade. Further to this point, I should like to ask Mr. Dodds the following questions about the Socialist Party's attitude to these allowances: (1) Does he deny that the T.U.C. rejected the idea of allowances in 1930, and that the Socialist Party resisted an amendment to increase the allowance for the children of unemployed persons in 1929? (2) What was done by the Socialist Government during their term of office in 1929–31 towards the introduction of family allowances? (3) Has any Socialist Member from the Opposition Bench ever been such a staunch champion of these allowances as to raise the matter in Parliament during the period between the wars?

</p>, <p>If Mr. Dodds goes into the matter carefully, he will find that his own Party's record in this matter is not an active one. I do not chastise them for that, as I think the other great measures of social reform carried out by Tory Governments between the wars were all necessary to prepare the foundations for the final comprehensive plan. But it does not seem fair politics to attack the Tories in order to draw attention from the Socialists' poor record in this matter.

</p>, <p>As I shall not be at Mr. Dodds ' “Socialist fairy tales about the Tory Party” meeting, I should be grateful if he would depart from his usual habit of leaving questions until that date, and answer those above through the courtesy of your columns.—Yours faithfully,

<span class="comment">(3) <i>Dartford Chronicle</i>, 30 September 1949</span> </p>, <p class="nonmt">Dear Sir,—As a result of a misleading speech by Miss Roberts, this subject was introduced into your columns, and now for the second time she not only ignores my query about the 17 <i>years</i> of strong (in numbers) Conservative Governments in between the war years, but raises questions about the stewardship of a Labour Government (in office, but not in power) for as many <i>months</i> from 1929 to 1931. In her previous letter she gave specific details which are even more misleading than her original speech, in what can be termed, even for politics, a “below the belt” attack, which went as follows: “The Socialist Party resisted an amendment to the Unemployment Insurance Bill of 1929 to increase the children's allowance from 2s. to 5s. In the Division which followed, 204 Socialists, led by Margaret Bondfield, then Minister of Labour, voted against the increase.” 

</p>, <p>But what a different picture this becomes when the full facts are known. On the Committee Stage of the Unemployment Insurance (No. 2) Bill on December 3, 1929, Miss Jennie Lee (Labour) moved an amendment to increase the allowance. This was opposed by Miss Bondfield on the ground that the Bill, which contained many desirable provisions for unemployed persons, together with other legislation the Government had to get a Supplementary Estimate before Christmas (only a matter of days away), and it would have been impossible to do so by adding a further indebtedness of over £4,000,000 at that late stage. Those familiar with Parliamentary procedure will appreciate this explanation.

</p>, <p>It is what Miss Roberts left unsaid that is of such great importance—the amendment went to a division, presenting a golden opportunity for the 258 Tory M.P.'s to indicate their desire for family allowances. But what are the facts? The proposed increase was supported by 32 Socialists, four Liberals and three others, but not one single Tory M.P. supported the proposed increase, and, furthermore, they solidly voted against this humanitarian Bill in both the Second and Third Readings.

</p>, <p>I want to make it clear that I am convinced Miss Roberts had no intention of deliberately misleading the public, but really she must be more careful. In many of her recent speeches she has introduced matters which it is impossible to deal with in the Press, and as it is vitally important that the public should have the facts, I should like to know if Miss Roberts is prepared to discuss them in public.—Yours faithfully,

<span class="comment"><i>Dartford Chronicle</i>, 7 October 1949</span> </p>, <p class="mt">Dear Sir,—Further to last week's letter on family allowances:—

</p>, <p>(1) Mr. Dodds offers a feeble and involved excuse which shrouds the real reason for the defeat of the 1929 amendment to increase the children's allowance for families of unemployed persons. The blunt fact of the matter was that under the Socialist Government the Unemployment Insurance Fund got into such serious debt that it could not stand any further expenses. By the time the Socialists were driven from office this fund was £100,000,000 in debt. To increase the drain on it at the time seemed an unwise suggestion to both the Socialists and the Tories who voted against the amendment.

</p>, <p>(2) I see Mr. Dodds does not deny that the T.U.C. rejected the principle of cash family allowances in 1930. The T.U.C. did not reverse its decision until 1942.

</p>, <p>(3) In answer to my query, Mr. Dodds does not give the names of any Socialist Members who raised the matter of family allowances for all, from Opposition benches between the wars. Usually, if a party is burning with enthusiasm about a principle, it voices its keenness in the House. If the sitting Member has been unable to find any names, I take it there are none.

</p>, <p>(4) In order to clear up a lot of misunderstanding, may I give a very brief history of the movement for family allowances. In 1924 Eleanor Rathbone, who represented no party, conceived the original idea. She set out her views in a book, entitled “The Disinherited Family,” published that year. From 1924 to 1929, as she herself put it, the progress was “mainly one of opinion.” In 1929 she was returned as Independent Member for Combined English Universities. Outside the House she began to convert all-party women's organisations to her way of thinking. Inside Parliament she managed to gain the support of many individual Members from all parties. In 1940 an allparty Members' group was founded to further the cause. In 1941 152 Members of all parties signed a motion in favour of a “National State-paid scheme of family allowances.” From this time the demand was put forward by all parties together, and, as your readers know, the report of the Beveridge Committee in 1942 put forward the suggestion as part of a comprehensive scheme. The Family Allowances Bill was put on the Statute Book in June, 1945, and the first cash benefits paid in 1946.

</p>, <p>In the light of these events, it is most unfair of Mr. Dodds to attack the Tories over this matter, when the Socialists were far from constructive about it themselves in the years between the wars.

</p>, <p>Let us both be honest and say (as I said in my original speech on this subject) that the real tribute should go to Eleanor Rathbone. She belonged to neither party, but eventually enlisted the support of both, and that support grew simultaneously on both sides.

</p>, <p>Finally, Sir, I see the long-expected challenge has come. Now that Mr. Dodds and I are on speaking terms—thanks to the good offices of the Chairman of Crayford Urban District Council—perhaps we could arrange a private meeting between the officials of both parties so that we could fix a date, frame a motion, draw up a procedure, select a non-party chairman, and organise the seating arrangements, etc. to our mutual satisfaction. I will leave it to Mr. Dodds to contact the Conservative office at 74, Spital-street, to fix this preliminary meeting.—Yours faithfully,

After all, women live in contact with food supplies, housing shortages, and the ever-decreasing opportunities for children, and we must therefore face up to the position, remembering that as more power is taken away from the people, so there is less responsibility for us to assume.” 

</p>, <p>So said Miss Margaret Roberts, young and pretty prospective Conservative M.P. for Dartford, in a speech described by Bexley Conservative Women's Section as “the best ever heard from a woman,” at Bexley Conservative Ladies' Luncheon Club at the Embassy Rooms, Welling, on Thursday last week.

</p>, <p>In her further remarks, Miss Roberts suggested that the root of our problems lay deeper than economic causes—it was in the lives of the ordinary human being and the declining fundamental decency. “We have got to get back to giving as well as getting,” she said.

</p>, <p>Miss Roberts said that a tremendous change had taken place in the status and work of women since the beginning of the century. The achievements of women since they had gained the vote was not only in the work of women M.P.'s, but in the work done by ordinary women with no claim to fame or special qualifications. No country in the world could equal Britain in the amount of work undertaken and the political power gained by its women.

</p>, <p> “It is an achievement not to be under-rated,” declared Miss Roberts. “When we were given the vote many feminists tended to regard it only as a right, but we have accepted the responsibility that goes with it, and that responsibility has been fulfilled by the women of this country.” 

</p>, <p> “I believe that personal responsibility is the key-note of the future,” she added, “and I feel that it is one of the chief charges we lay at the door of the present Government that personal responsibility is far less now than before, and something must be done about it. This ‘passing the buck’ attitude of to-day is not the sort of thing which will get us out of the mess we are in, and we, as women, realize it.” 

</p>, <p> “Most of us,” she added, “are housewives—perhaps the most worth-while occupation in the world—and we are perturbed as to the kind of future offered for our children.

</p>, <p> “We cast our votes, sit on councils and other bodies, doing our share to overcome the social ills, and in these days of State assistance let us not forget the tremendous number of children still looked after by voluntary effort, without any assistance at all from the State. May that responsibility and enterprise never die out in this country.”

(prospective candidate), when Northumberland Heath men's branch of the Conservative Association was re-formed, at a meeting at the Pheasant Hall, Northumberland Heath, on Thursday last week.

</p>, <p>Miss Roberts said she was grateful to Mr. J. F. L. Gates for the tremendous amount of work he had done in Northumberland Heath. There were too many people saying “Why don't the Conservatives do something about it?” The answer was that those people should join them and help do something about it. She was pleased to see so many people present that evening, who were going to be “doers.” 

</p>, <p>The Labour Party frequently accused the Conservatives of having no policy, but Miss Roberts counter—claimed that the Government had no policy to get the country out of the economic crisis. Sooner or later the Conservative Party would be called upon to get the country out of the mess it was in. If the Labour Government were returned for another five years the position would be such that Britain might never return to normal.

</p>, <p>There might well be a General Election in the early autumn, and only 21 days' statutory notice was necessary. That was merely 19 working days to prepare posters and canvass householders. The election had legally to come in the next 200 days, and put like that it was not long to get prepared.

</p>, <p>Miss Roberts thought there was a good chance of “pulling the Division” if each section pulled together and worked as a team. It might be said that she had “a vested interest in the Division.” (Laughter.)

</p>, <p>Mr. Gates said there was an exceptionally strong women's branch in that area and they wanted to see the men's branch equally lusty. They would work for Miss Roberts, for she was an excellent candidate and was becoming well-known throughout the country.

</p>, <p>Proposing that a branch be formed, Mr. R. W. Wait said there were originally 100 members in Northumberland Heath Men's Conservative Association. The motion was seconded by Mr. W. J. Harding.

</p>, <p>The Chairman of Crayford Council (Mr. S. A. Lyle) introduced the parties, describing them as “very plucky individuals.” He was very pleased to have them at Crayford, “a centre to introduce two people who will, we hope make history for this country.”

They were Mr. J. Baker White, M.P. for Canterbury, Mrs. Dorothy Welfare, Miss Margaret Roberts, and Mr. Ted Leather (Conservative candidates for Bethnal Green, Dartford and North Somerset respectively.

</p>, <p>Written questions were submitted by members of the large audience, and the first, selected at random by the question-master (Mr. J. L. M. Miller), was a topical one: “What does the brains trust think of Mr. Attlee 's statement to the House to-day?” 

</p>, <p>Mr. Baker White summed up his opinion as, “We expected an outsize axe to be produced, but got something like a pair of nail scissors.” 

</p>, <p>He said it was difficult to sort it all out at the moment, and any impression he gave now, from a first hearing and a first reading, he might have to revise later. But he thought there were other things that could have been cut, such as Government publicity. This cost £16,000,000 a year and there would have been no harm in cutting it to half.

</p>, <p>It was also surprising that nothing had been done about open cost mining. The 1s. charge on prescriptions he thought wise, as it would go some way towards getting rid of the idea that these things were free.

</p>, <p>But it seemed to him the Government had missed an enormous opportunity. After all, cutting did not produce incentive, and if they wanted output they had to give people something to work for.

</p>, <p>Mrs. Welfare, who described herself as “an ordinary working man's wife—my husband is a house painter,” criticised the £5,000 a year salaries of officials on the Coal Board. She condemned the 1s. prescriptions because she thought the working people were paying quite enough, and considered an incentive should have been provided by a reduction of Income Tax on over time.

</p>, <p>Mr. Leather felt quite certain the cuts bore out what they had all been saying for weeks: that there was not one cut or economy that would not have been far better made at least two or three years ago. If they had been made then, they would not be in the shocking position they were in now.

</p>, <p>Miss Roberts thought what the Government had done was only a fleabite, and they had not been as ruthless as they should have been. They were not going to abandon their partisan tactics and set the people free with incentives, and as far as cuts on overheads went, they had now started to do what the Tory policy advocated over four years ago.

</p>, <p>Mr. Baker White added that one opportunity the Government had missed was to cut the salaries of Ministers and Members of Parliament, as an example to the country.

</p>, <p>Another topical question was: “What effect will devaluation have on the housewife, and will it result in unemployment?” 

</p>, <p>Mrs. Welfare replied that devaluation had already hit the housewife, as it was she who had to pay the little bit extra on the loaf, and it was also ‘hitting the old age pensioner. As regards unemployment, she recalled that after the 1914–18 war Germany and Japan had flooded the market with goods cheaper than we could produce them here, and it meant unemployment in Britain. She foresaw this happening again.

</p>, <p>Mr. Leather said there was no doubt that the cost of living was bound to go up. The risk of unemployment was greater than before, because increased costs would kill the market for many goods, and unemployment might well be a subsidiary result.

</p>, <p>Miss Roberts thought that in spite of devaluation, we should not succeed in closing the dollar gap. She could not see how this could be done by visible exports and imports. The only way was to get the Americans to invest their money through confidence in British business.

</p>, <p>Mr. Baker White believed devaluation might result in a ten per cent. rise in the cost of living, and might cause temporary unemployment; but he saw no reason why there should be extensive unemployment if the transition was carried out in a proper fashion.,

</p>, <p> “Will Conservatives discontinue payments of children's allowances when they are returned to power?” was another question.

</p>, <p> “Certainly not,” replied Mr. Baker White. “Children's allowances were brought in by a Conservative Government.” 

</p>, <p>To the question, “If the Conservatives are returned to power, would they discontinue subsidies and remove food control?” Miss Roberts replied that they would not abolish rationing or price control on any necessity until there was enough of it to go round.

</p>, <p>The next question was, “Is membership of a trade union compatible with support of the Conservative Party?” and, in reply, Mr. Leather produced his own trade union card. He said trade unions were full of Tories, but what they believed was that trade unionists should be trade unionists and not party politicians.

</p>, <p>The Trust answered nearly a dozen other questions, and Mr. Miller said they would organise a similar event later on.</p>, <p>Copyright © Margaret Thatcher Foundation 2018. All Rights Reserved.

</p>, <p>She also referred to the National Savings movement; they had to support the two things for the recovery of the world. They had to put them on a sound financial footing and must also work for a united peace.

</p>, <p>Wing Commander Millington said the people were all discussing international affairs. They gave opinions without learning the A.B.C. of these affairs or of the United Nations Organisation, which alone stood between the people of the world and the enormous conflict for which the great Powers were preparing at that very moment. Therefore the first function of U.N.A. branches was self-education.

</p>, <p>It was useless saying this or that action of the Russians, or the Chinese, or the Americans, or whoever they did not like, was not in conformity with the United Nations Charter unless they knew what the Charter said.

</p>, <p>Unless they knew what they were talking about, they were doing a greater disservice to peace than if they kept their mouths shut. They must make a positive effort to sacrifice time and energy in seeking to instruct and inform themselves.

</p>, <p>The second thing to do was to inform others around them. They must never lose the opportunity to say a good thing, arising out of their knowledge and understanding, about international affairs. Dissemination of good news in the world took them a step nearer peace, and the dissemination of bad news a step nearer war.

</p>, <p>To affect the passage of events was the third thing they wanted to do. Mass membership of an informed character meant that they, the people, could influence their M.P., Foreign Secretary and the United Nations itself, providing they had a constructive organisation which could be interpreted as being the informed will of a mass of the people. The tragedy was that no one could say that about any international or peace organisation in this country at the moment.

</p>, <p>Throughout the whole world the development of international politics had taken them no nearer to peace, not because the Charter or the Foreign Secretaries were bad, but because they, the people, were not determined and had not accepted the challenge the post-war world had put upon them.

</p>, <p>He begged every person who was free to have an independent thought to use it now at whatever the sacrifice. Unless they used it now it would be too late.

</p>, <p>Miss Margaret Roberts (prospective Conservative candidate for the Dartford Division) said the ordinary people might think they could do very little, but they could do a great deal, and it was their duty to put into it the maximum effort of which they were capable.

</p>, <p>Mr. Norman Dodds, M.P., called for more members for the Dartford branch of U.N.A., and seven people volunteered.

</p>, <p>Mr. H. Gregory Pearce and Mr. W. R. Dingle spoke on behalf of the National Savings movement, and Canon Elliott Michell (president of Dartford U.N.A.) expressed thanks to all concerned.

</p>, <p>The service was conducted by the Rev. L. F. Webb, who preached on the text: “… And they shall beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks; nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.” 

</p>, <p>He spoke of the need to realise the ideals for which so many had died, and said the implementing of the promises in the United Nations Charter depended on ordinary men and women.

</p>, <p>There were four ways in which they could help. They could be absolutely convinced that peace on earth was possible and not let it be empty idealism; they also had a glorious opportunity to promote the ideals of peace in the children and young people, and to capture their enthusiasm and imagination for the cause; the third thing was to give the foreigners in this country a good impression to take back to their own countries. Lastly, but most important of all, they could help the cause by prayer.

</p>, <p>The choir sang the anthem, “Turn back, O man,” and the service concluded with the National Anthem.</p>, <p>Copyright © Margaret Thatcher Foundation 2018. All Rights Reserved.

</p>, <p><i>Conservative Candidate for the Dartford Division of Kent</i>
</p>, <p>Local government has been one of the most valuable features of our national life: it has enabled town and country to be administered by men on the spot, in daily contact with local conditions. A community spirit has grown up amongst the people, and there has developed a fine tradition of voluntary service, which has played a great part in shaping the individual character of the British nation.

</p>, <p>There have been many changes recently. Local authorities now have very different powers and responsibilities, and as a result of increased taxation, it is becoming difficult to find suitable men and women willing to give up their spare time to serve on local councils.

</p>, <p>To assess the present situation, we must first view the historical background, which will give us a true perspective of the structure and the functions of local government. The Industrial Revolution of the nineteenth century raised many local problems. Growing cities brought dirt and disease, problems of law and order, and difficulties with fresh water supplies: street paving and lighting and transport were needed. Separate Commissions and Trusts had grown up in many cities to deal with such matters. In 1835, under the Municipal Corporations Act, elected councils were formed, whose functions amalgamated many of those previously carried out by the Trusts. The councils, whose meetings had to be held in public, were to provide police, to see that the streets were paved and lit, and were to make bye-laws for the good government of the locality. They were allowed to levy rates, and their accounts were subject to audit.

</p>, <p>The present structural pattern of local government is based on the Conservative Local Government Act of 1888. Elected County Councils were created, including the London County Council, thus establishing the upper tier of what has to-day become the three-tier system of local government. Boroughs with a population of over 50,000 were given the status of ‘County Boroughs’, which exercised the functions of both County and Borough Councils. Parish Councils were formed in the rural parishes; and in rural areas the Parish Rural District and County Councils formed an inter-related structure of authority. The new regional authorities might be considered to-day to add a fourth, but not elected, tier. But from 1888 every community, from <span class="page">[end p1]</span> the smallest village to the largest town, was provided with some form of elected local government.

</p>, <p>There is no sharp dividing line between the functions of County Councils and those of Borough and Urban District Councils. Since the war there has been a considerable redistribution of functions, not only between the tiers of local government but also between central and local government, mostly to the detriment of the latter. Before 1939, although there were considerable local variations on the general pattern, the duties were broadly as follows: County Councils were principally concerned with (i) secondary and elementary education; (ii) certain public health services including some hospitals; (iii) public assistance; (iv) maintenance of main roads; and (v) (in some cases) police forces. Borough Councils looked after: (i) certain public health services including hospitals, maternity and child welfare, ambulances, &amp;c.; (ii) housing and town planning, including parks and open spaces; (iii) highways, other than main roads, and street lighting; (iv) municipal electricity, gas and water undertakings; (v) corporation transport; (vi) fire services; (vii) police forces; (viii) all sanitary arrangements—refuse collection, sewerage, &amp;c.; and (ix) provision of libraries, museums, &amp;c.

</p>, <p>Local authorities therefore had many diverse responsibilities the sum total of which demanded men of high calibre to carry them out. Conditions varied from area to area, but the men on the spot knew the needs of the locality and did their best to meet them. And above all, a part of the electorate took a very real interest in the council's activities—from road maintenance to the provision of hospitals. The latter in particular benefited greatly from the devoted service of voluntary workers.

</p>, <p>Acts passed through Parliament during the lifetime of the present Government have effected considerable alterations in the powers of local councils. Control of all hospitals, for instance, has been vested in the Ministry of Health. The Minister, instead of delegating powers to local authorities, has appointed Regional Boards; and hospitals have consequently been removed completely from the sphere of local government. Similarly, electricity and gas services, since they were nationalised, have been under the jurisdiction of Regional Boards.

</p>, <p>Responsibility for the police forces and fire services has been transferred from Borough Councils to County Councils, as have ambulances and maternity and child welfare services.

</p>, <p>The local planning authority, under the Town and Country Planning Act, has likewise been put at County Council level whereas previously it was at Borough Council level. But it should be noted that authority, while charged with producing a plan for the development of its own area, zoning it for industrial and other uses, sends no official representative to the panels dealing with the distribution of industry. These panels, also, consist of appointed, not elected, representatives.

</p>, <p>In all the above cases, powers have been taken away from the smaller authorities and transferred to the larger authority. Often the larger authority is the central government itself, which, not being designed for day-to-day administration of public services, has to delegate its powers to non-elected bodies. As one spokesman has said, it is government by selection, not election.

</p>, <p>The consequences of these changes are more far-reaching than is generally realised. Firstly, local interest and voluntary work are severely reduced. Efficient services have been built up by people who chose to spend their leisure hours in the service of their fellow-men. Voluntary work of this kind has been a great feature of British life and it has not received sufficient recognition and thanks from our political opponents, who have replaced it with the apathetic ‘I thought the State provided that’, the unspoken implication being, ‘therefore, I'm not going <span class="page">[end p2]</span> to bother to do anything about it’. This attitude, which loss of local responsibility does so much to encourage, is surely contrary to the best British standards, and is having a very damaging effect on the whole country.

</p>, <p>Secondly, loss of public utility services frequently means serious loss of revenue. For instance, Erith in North Kent had a very flourishing electricity undertaking which contributed a total of £27,011 to the local exchequer. Since Nationalisation this contribution has ceased and the compensation here, as elsewhere, is notoriously inadequate. The loss to Erith equals a 1s. 8¾d. rate, and the rates have now gone up by this amount plus 3¼d. But for electricity nationalisation, the rate need only have increased by 3¼d. It is interesting to note the reaction of the local Socialist Party towards the matter. In a pamphlet headed <i>Realism</i> they said:

</p>, <p></p>, <p>Thirdly, there arises the problem of finding suitable candidates for local government. If local councils are left only with control over such things as street lighting, cemeteries, allotments and museums, they will not attract councillors of the present calibre. Councils will no longer consist of men and women to whom the electorate can look for local leadership. Civic pride, already on the wane, will disappear, and the authority and respect for local government, one of the pillars of democracy, will begin to crumble away.

</p>, <p>During the last municipal elections, the issue of whether or not party politics are detrimental to local government, once again came to the fore, and it has many important implications. The Acts which have been rushed through Parliament by our opponents, affect, as we have seen above, every level of government. As many of them contain proposals quite contrary to the principles of Conservatism, it is vital that Conservatives everywhere should fight to improve and modify them on every occasion and at every level of government.

</p>, <p>There are a number of people who claim that party politics are divorced from local affairs. Such a contention I believe to be false. Politics touch every sphere of personal life. Consider the case of a family searching for a house and unable to find one. If the two major parties hold different views, as they do, on the quickest way of supplying the demand for houses, then party politics affect that family through housing. Since housing problems are dealt with at local government level, it follows that party politics concern local government too. To instance a second example: suppose a returned ex-service man who has built up a successful business wants to extend his premises. He has to apply to the Town and Country Planning authority for permission, and is liable to have to pay a development charge. The latter point is the cause of great controversy between the parties, so here, too, party politics, this time at County Council level, affect the ordinary man.

</p>, <p>The question may be asked, ‘If Parliament has made a decision, what can local councils do about it, even if they disagree?’ The rules and regulations may be decreed, but the way in which they are carried out makes a great difference to the person they affect, and can help to lighten local burdens imposed by the policy of the central government.

</p>, <p>Let us now consider the case from the candidate's point of view. Many arguments against party candidates in local government are based on the fallacy that a party-political candidate cannot serve his fellow-citizens as well as a non-party candidate. More than one correspondent in <i>The Times</i> has argued along these lines. It is suggested that since councillors owe a duty to the entire electorate, those sponsored by one party are unsuitable. Mr. Neville Hobson in a letter to <i>The Times</i> published on 23rd April 1949, goes on to say that nothing could be more <span class="page">[end p3]</span> anomalous than ‘complete subjugation of personal views to party opinions prescribed by a majority vote within a party group’.

</p>, <p>In the first place, councillors certainly do owe a duty to the entire electorate in exactly the same way as do Members of Parliament. It is a strong Conservative principle that elected members should realise this and carry out their duties accordingly. Secondly, the arguments imply that the principles and policies of party political organisations are not planned for the whole electorate, but only for particular sections. This may be true of the left-wing parties, but those of the right believe implicitly in the unity of the British people, and their policies are calculated to benefit the entire nation. There can be no objection to Conservative candidates on these grounds.

</p>, <p>Thirdly, join to a political party is not to ‘subjugate’ one's own personal views to any ‘party dogma’. A person joins a party when his views are broadly <i>in agreement</i> with those principles for which the party stands. He does not renounce his views in any way; he merely joins an association of like-minded people. Disagreement may arise on certain points, but then the person will vote according to his own conscience and there is nothing in the Conservative Party to dissuade him from doing so. It is only when disagreement arises over a basic principle of the party that the Whips take action.

</p>, <p>It is further suggested that if local elections become more party political, only those prepared to fight on such a basis will have any prospect of success. But if a person wants to fight an election, there is nothing to prevent him from standing as an Independent and opposing the political candidates. The electorate will decide between them. And in local, if not in parliamentary elections, the Conservatives have not yet adopted the practice of putting up an official candidate to oppose a right-wing Independent.

</p>, <p>The character of local government has changed vastly in the last four years. Local authorities have been denuded of many powers, some of which have been transferred to nominated boards under the control of Ministers. This conflicts directly with the Conservative principle that power should be as widely diffused and as directly responsible to the electorate as possible. Conservatives have, therefore, decided to extend their own fight to local government level, believing that a Conservative candidate can serve his electorate as well, if not better, than an Independent. Finally, that fight will be fought with ever-increasing vigour so long as local democratic government is endangered.</p>, <p>Copyright © Margaret Thatcher Foundation 2018. All Rights Reserved.

They have been pursuing that policy for the past six months, and already have 500 new members in Crayford, where previously there was no branch.

</p>, <p>In Erith two organised canvasses have taken place, and there are to be more in the borough and other parts of the constituency shortly. The association's aim is to know every Conservative supporter in the Division.

</p>, <p>The latest meeting in the series to form brances was held at Belvedere Conservative Club on Thursday last week, when Belvedere (men's) branch was inaugurated, within the framework of Erith Borough Group to cover Belvedere South district.

</p>, <p>Miss Margaret Roberts, B.A., B.Sc., prespective candidate, admitted that the Labour Party still had the best election machine. Conservatives had never made such a minute study of propaganda as the other side. To be properly organised, they had to know every supporter and, if possible, make them active members. Of the people who did not vote at the last election, at least 50 per cent. were Tories, thought Miss Roberts.

</p>, <p>Labour did not win elections with a superior policy or better leaders, but, to some degree, through Conservative apathy, she said. Since 1945 the Labour Party had been improving their election machine, and the Conservative Association still had some way to go before they had the strongest organisation.

</p>, <p>Miss Roberts wished to make it clear that it was not a matter of the Labour Party standing still and the Conservatives going forward. Both organisations had been working hard since 1945.

</p>, <p>At the last election they had relied too much on the personal popularity or their leaders, and she did not want to see that done to the same extent at the coming General Election. There was not likely to be a “snap” election this year, and some people were disappointed. Miss Roberts did not think they would have been ready if there had been an election, and the association had to work to be ready when it came.

</p>, <p>After being keyed-up for the election, some members thought they could sit back and relax. They thought they would be returned, to a degree, on the other side's faults. The results of the L.C.C. by-election had given them the shaking up they needed.

</p>, <p>Conservative apathy was the theme of an address by Mr. J. F. L. Gates (chairman, Erith Borough Group), who said that if industrialists were giving the association millions of pounds, he would like to see some of it in the Dartford Division. They depended on individual subscriptions, and some of the Fighting Fund had come from this constituency—a poor Division. Members would be surprised if they knew just how poor the local association was.

</p>, <p>Mr. R. A. Neale was elected chairman, and the secretary is Mr. D. H. Lewis, 1, Cowper-road, Belvedere. Mr. J. P. Bruces was chosen as hon. treasurer, and the committee elected were Messrs. U. Wilson, E. W. King, J. Stevenson, L. G. Batson and C. A. Ericsson.

</p>, <p>Present at the meeting was Mr. J. B. Dixson (hon. secretary, Erith Borough Group) and Councillor C. E. Parker.

The main hall was packed to capacity, and many people were unable to get in.

</p>, <p>Mr. J. W. Panton, a member of the Conservative Party, explained that he had been asked by Mr. Dodds to take the chair. After the meeting tributes were paid to him for his unbiased handling of the debate.

</p>, <p>Mr. Dodds, opening the debate, said foreigners had been greatly puzzled in the past two or three years at the peculiar phenomenon of British public life. They could not understand how the Government had not lost one Parliamentary seat right through a long series of by-elections—34 in all—and yet, in speeches by prominent members of the Opposition, particularly Mr. Churchill, there had been presented a picture of the British people being under-nourished, fatigued, and almost down-and-out. He (Mr. Dodds) welcomed the opportunity of bringing forward some facts which supported the wisdom of the electorate.

</p>, <p>The last year in which the people could be satisfied about the economic state of the country was 1913. Then came the 1914–18 war. Immediately afterwards Britain had to make use of income from overseas investments to pay for the things required. The position got steadily worse; in 1936–7–8 the country was headed for bankruptcy. The recent war had left Britain a good deal poorer.

</p>, <p>Since then the Government had faced a very difficult task, a task which had been made worse by some of the speeches made—a great many of them not according to fact—throughout the length and breadth of the world. They had been responsible, in some measure, for lowering the confidence of other countries in Britain.

</p>, <p>Mr. Dodds gave figures on production levels. With the execption of Denmark and Sweden, Britain's production, he said, was more than that of any other European country. With regard to imports and exports, the United Kingdom had the best figures of all. She was the only European country to reduce her dependence on the dollar, thanks to John Strachey.

</p>, <p>The speaker also referred to the controversy over devaluation, and mentioned the “clamping down almost overnight” of the buying by America of rubber, tin and cocoa. The situation had become desperate and the pound was devlaued. But for Sir Stafford Cripps the economic state would be very much worse than it actually was, said Mr. Dodds.

</p>, <p>Miss Roberts said that as yet there had been no incentive to build up any more of those overseas investments possessed by Britain before the war. They had not in any way been a debtor nation in those years. Never once did they have to go to America with their hats out. In those years the pound sterling stood where the dollar stood now.

</p>, <p>With regard to Mr. Dodds praise of Mr. Strachey, Miss Roberts said the business of bulk buying was all very well on a rising market, but when the market was a falling one, they were coming back with a total loss.

</p>, <p>She quoted the case of maize last year. It also happened (claimed the speaker) in food, raw materials and the metal market. Tin had been taken off bulk buying—and its price had been falling ever since.

</p>, <p> “I do not think much of a Minister who tried to skate away from responsibility on the groundnuts scheme.” 

</p>, <p>Miss Roberts went on to say that the Food Minister could not escape responsibility, whoever he sacked.

</p>, <p>In reply to her opponent's remarks about speeches made by Opposition speakers, Miss Roberts said that when Mr. Eden toured the Empire he did not make one derogatory remark about the country; instead, he did all he could to bolster up the country— “which takes some doing,” she remarked.

</p>, <p>Mr. Dodds, in his second speech (of ten minutes) mentioned that Britain had repaid £661,000,000 in sterling balances, besides giving away two-thirds (£926,000,000) of the money she had received from Marshall Aid. The sum total thus obtained exceeded the aid received by more than £200,000,000.

</p>, <p>Miss Roberts said that devaluation meant that they had to increase their exports to dollar areas by 44 per cent. to survive at the same rate. To do this on their own feet they would have to increase by 100 per cent. How was that to be done? The only way was to get American people to invest in this country.

</p>, <p>Miss Roberts submitted that Americans had not been willing to put their money into Britain because they were afraid of it being confiscated by nationalisation. Even as she spoke, she said, sterling deals were being made as low as 2.55 Were they in for further devaluation?

</p>, <p>At question time, typical queries were “If we are in such a terrible state, why has the Government not lost a by-election?” 

</p>, <p>Miss Roberts said that most by-elections had been fought in places where there had been large Socialist majorities before; and anyway, Marshall Aid had obscured the true economic position to many people.

</p>, <p>In reply to the query, “In view of the situation at the end of the war, why did not the Government start putting the country right before nationalisation?” Mr. Dodds said that the Government believed that nationalisation was the measure for putting things right.

</p>, <p>Winding -up speeches were made by the debaters.

</p>, <p>Miss Roberts asked if it would not have been better for the Government to let each nationalised industry prove its worth before nationalising others? “They have no policy for when Marshall Aid ends” she said. “We can only hope that you, the public, will restore a Government which, in its turn, will restore confidence, so that the pound can look the dollar in the face and not in the bootlaces.” , she concluded.

</p>, <p>Mr. Dodds' main point in a brief final speech was that in August of that year there were 3,780,000 more people working than in 1938. “I believe that if there were any more of these debates, Miss Roberts will want to join the Labour Party. May I ask her a favour? When she wants to join, will she let me have the pleasure of enrolling her?” he said.

</p>, <p>Mr. Dodds proposed a vote of thanks to the chairman, whom he described as “a master of the craft of chairmanship.” 

</p>, <p>Miss Roberts seconded this expression of thanks to “the very best chairman in the district.”

</p>, <p>The main part of Miss Roberts' address was taken up in seeking to prove that the Conservative Party's criticisms of the Socialist administration were not just “fairy tales,” and her first point was that the estimated figure of £75,000,000 losses on nationalised industries was not a “phoney” one. It was a figure by which the Conservative Central Office was standing, she said, and after showing how it was arrived at she quoted the following statement from the Central Office:—

</p>, <p> “There is no truth in the statement published by “The People” to the effect that the leaflet recently issued by the Conservation Central Office is inaccurate. We estimate that the losses sustained by the nationalised industries are at least £75,000,000. We confirm the statistics quoted in the leaflet entitled ‘Messrs. C. R. Attlee and Co., General Jobbers.’ No official of the Conservative Central Office made a statement attributed to him by Norman Dodds, Socialist M.P. for Dartford.” 

</p>, <p>Another “fairy tale” was in regard to unemployment. A statement attributed to Lord Balfour of Burleigh in the economic debate had been wrenched from its context. He knew well the problems of unemployment and had said that he did not want anyone to accuse him of making mass unemployment. He did not recommend mass unemployment for industrial discipline. Lord Woolton had also repudiated the suggestion that the Conservative Party wanted it.

</p>, <p>She asked the Socialists present to tell her any time when unemployment was higher when the Conservatives left office than when they went into it. They had always reduced it during their term of office.

</p>, <p> “The original American loan should still have been lasting us,” continued Miss Roberts. “But it disappeared into thin air and Mr. Dalton had nothing but a ‘song in his heart’ to show for it. More help came in the shape of Marshall Aid, but once again what happened? We found that it was not enough. We are not closing the gap with Marshall Aid so where would we be without it?” asked the candidate.

</p>, <p>The policy of over-spending, which brought about devaluation and a resultant increase in the cost of living, still persisted, she said.

</p>, <p>Addressing the meeting before the formation of the new branch, Miss Margaret Roberts, B.A., B.Sc., prospective Conservative candidate for Dartford Division, said that after that meeting, when they would have a branch in every ward in the Division, it would be possible to regain Dartford for the Conservatives in the General Election.

</p>, <p>In the last election, out of an electorate of 77,000 only about 57,000 voted. This left a “doubtful” 20,000, who were probably inactive Conservative sympathisers. It was Miss Roberts opinion that, at the last election, all those who were Socialist supporters had gone to the polls.

</p>, <p>If those 20,000 electors could be brought to the polls to vote Conservative in the forthcoming election, together with those whose political conviction had swung from Left to Right during the last four years, then the Conservative Party could win the Dartford Division.

Roberts, B.A., B.Sc., prospective Conservative candidate for Dartford, spoke on “Devaluation” at the first meeting held by the new Barnehurst (North) branch, at Crayford-Barnehurst County Primary School on Thursday last week.

</p>, <p>Miss Roberts accused the Government of a breach of faith in not giving Continental governments adequate notice of their intention to devalue the pound, or of the extent of that devaluation.

</p>, <p> “As a result of this one government fell, but it was the wrong government—it was that of France,” said Miss Roberts.

</p>, <p>At that time the Council of Europe was meeting at Strasbourg and the Labour members gave the impression that Britain would not devalue. The whole theme of that conference was co-operation, but if that was the British Government's idea of co-operation with Continental countries then they had better revise their ideas quickly.

</p>, <p>The Government repeatedly said that devaluation would never happen as it would lower the value of wages and social services and would be folly; yet when they did it, they put it over, not as a defeat, but as a victory.

</p>, <p>Discussing the causes, Miss Roberts said there could be no doubt that devaluation had to come because of the Government's economic policy over the past four years. There had been a series of crises met with nothing more than expedients, and the position had gradually worsened. This last time the country was keyed up for severe cuts, but instead of a clarion call they only heard a feeble toot. Once again the Government was only hanging on for the General Election.

</p>, <p>How much longer could they hang on? Her audience must have noticed from their newspapers that the value of the pound was still going down, so that the latest expedient of devaluation was not the turning point in the crisis.

</p>, <p><span class="nm">Sir Stafford Cripps</span>The Chancellor of the Exchequer, when announcing devaluation, said it would make no immediate difference to the cost of living, except for a small increase in the price of bread, but very soon after that the Government put up the price of metal.

</p>, <p>The candidate then quoted from the <i>Dartford Chronicle and Kentish Times</i> a report on housing, which showed that costs were increasing as the direct result of devaluation. That meant rates must go up to cover the increased cost or rents must be increased.

</p>, <p>She also referred to specific imports from dollar countries, the price of which had increased and which in turn must affect the cost of living.

</p>, <p>Finally, Miss Roberts dealt with the sterling balances, and showed how these had been accumulated by Britain's purchases in India and other countries during the war, for the defence of those countries. One of the terms of the American loan was that the British Government should consult those countries with a view to scaling down the balances, but that they did not do for four years. Those balances were unfair and people at home ought not to be saddled with them, she declared.

</p>, <p>What would happen when Marshall Aid came to an end in 1952? Miss Roberts quoted the Red Queen's words to Alice: “We are having to run as fast as we can to stay where we are.” Now Britain was having to run 40 per cent faster, and in 1952 would have to increase her exports by 100 per cent. She doubted if that was possible.

</p>, <p>The only solution was to cut Government expenditure, cut costs and lower taxation. Conservatives had been advocating that for years. They must go on advocating it, and she hoped that, with the co-operation of the electors, it would not be for long.

</p>, <p>Mr. L. T. Whitehead presided, and Mr. J. W. Waterman (political survey director for Crayford sub-division) outlined his plans for “thoroughly combing the sub-division and building up a strong membership; paying particular attention to the floating vote.”

</p>, <p>The guests were welcomed by Past-president Rotarian A. J. McDonald.

</p>, <p>Miss Roberts, prospective Conservative candidate for Dartford, is a food research chemist, and in speaking about the problems of food and food research, she treated the subject entirely non-politically—even when it came to mentioning peanuts.

</p>, <p>Research was continually going on, she said, into ways and means of processing raw food materials, of keeping them up to required standards, and of packing. For instance, dried eggs were “traced back—almost to scratch” —(laughter)—by research chemists to find the cause of variations, and one of the latest researches to be done was to find out how peanuts could be roasted without losing any vitamins.

</p>, <p>Another recent problem concerned sandwiches which were to be eaten at 20,000ft. in the air. Conditions at that height were imitated in the laboratory, and a way found to pack the food to keep its freshness.

</p>, <p>Of the campaign for clean food, Miss Roberts said that perhaps the most important food tests were for bacteria, Every processed food put out by her firm underwent very severe test.

</p>, <p>Responding to the toast of “The Visitors,” Miss Roberts said Kent had so much—almost everything. It produced things from crockery to cricket, from scenery to cement (and cement dust), hops to helicopters (sometimes), from Whitbread to Wellcome, and last, but not least, it harboured Winston at Westerham.

</p>, <p>The branch hon. secretary, Mr. H. E. Kesterton, was able to report that there were now 240 ordinary members, and, he added “What we want to aim at is to swell that figure to 2,400.” 

</p>, <p>The toast of “The Visitors” was proposed by the Rev. V. S. Nicholls, Vicar of Meopham, who, in a reference to Miss Roberts, said, “She is a charming lady who, I am quite sure, will make a great name for herself in the coming months.” Her beauty and her speeches had won a great place in the hearts of the people of the neighbourhood.

</p>, <p>Responding, Miss Roberts said: “As Kent has already exported much of its talent and given liberally of its spirit to those who come to dwell here, it has not an adverse balance of trade in that respect.

</p>, <p> “We are very glad indeed, those of us who are thorough imports, to be living in the County of Kent. From afar we admired you throughout the whole of the war and I think no one, except those who either lived here or came here, knew just how much you went through.” 

</p>, <p>After the remarks quoted above, Miss Roberts said: “Can you wonder why some of us come to live in Kent with all that. When we came to live here we found one other thing—you stole our hearts.” 

</p>, <p>Those who came as visitors hoped not only to be entertained for a brief sojourn, but to become adopted by Kent and the association, and learn perhaps to do fresh honour to the name the association had already made so famous.

</p>, <p>Also responding to the toast was Mr. H. R. Pratt Boorman (chairman of the council), who remarked, “This part of Kent is hallowed ground to the Men of Kent and Kentish Men.” It was with the valued help of Mr. Grugeon and Mr. Kesterton that the branch had made progress in the last year or so. Membership of the association was growing rapidly and a drive was being made for new members. The membership was 3,200, which was small with a million people in the county. It was a curious thing that there were few wives with membership and the new drive should be directed at this aspect.

</p>, <p>The association fostered a love of the county in the hearts of Men of Kent and Kentish Men, and there was no finer figure than the president, Lord Cornwallis, who was the very spirit of the association.

</p>, <p>Mr. Boorman asked that Lord and Lady Cornwallis should be sent a telegram of good wishes, and that another should be conveyed to the county secretary, who was recovering from a serious illness.

</p>, <p>The health of the chairman was proposed by Mr. H. E. Kesterton, who said that under Mr. Grugeon 's guidance and help the branch had progressed enormously.

</p>, <p>After reviewing the year's events, Mr. Kesterton said the branch had added 47 new members. The total life membership was 30 and there were 240 ordinary members. What they wanted to aim at was to increase the figure to 2,400.

</p>, <p>Responding, Mr. Grugeon pointed out that the president, Sir Irving Albery, was unable to be present owing to the illness of his wife. He was sure members would like a message of sympathy to be sent to Lady Albery. He thanked all the officers for the hard work they had put in, especially in arranging that function.

On these pages, Bob Muller, the HEUTE correspondent in London, reports from the election campaign in Dartford, one of the largest constituencies.

</p>, <p>It would actually have to count against Margaret Roberts, the Conservative in Dartford constituency, that she is twentyfour years old, pretty, and tall. The English voter does not so easily allow himself to be influenced by external appearances—on the contrary, it makes him mistrustful when a party candidate appeals even to his sense of beauty. Anyone who thinks, however, that Margaret's political abilities could not be on a par with her looks will quickly learn better in conversation with her. As a true Englishwoman, she has her own opinions, very healthy and sensible opinions, which could be presented even before the experienced politicians in Parliament.

</p>, <p>Margie <i>[sic]</i> had already shown at nineteen that she was an expert on things which were rather outside the interests of her female contemporaries. She canvassed then in the slums of Oxford for a Conservative candidate, a rather difficult task in the election of 1945, and helped finally to ensure that he was elected. Today she is herself a candidate, and no easy opponent for the Labour candidate, Norman Dodds, who lives only a few steps from her home.

</p>, <p>While Dodds readily falls back on personal experiences of the Great Depression as an admonition, she knows about it only from books. Therefore she is equipped with good arguments from her own party's rich treasury of experience. And the five years of Socialism, which England has behind her, provide a number of starting points for Conservative attacks. “My election speeches proceed on the basis that nationalisation was a failure, that the <span class="page">[end p1]</span> Socialists have got us into a financial mess, and that Socialism restricts personal freedom too considerably.” 

</p>, <p>For other questions, she calls into play the political experience of the Conservatives. That applies especially to foreign policy. “Great Britain can only win the respect of the world again when the Foreign Office is headed by a Conservative.” She considers an early peace treaty with Germany to be important and supports a sharper policy towards Russia. All these things seem evident to many English voters, naturally, but she also boldly attacks the Labour Party's trump cards: “The health laws are extravagant. They should have been introduced gradually and economically” . About the almost complete absence of unemployment, one of the main arguments of the Labour Party, she says, “That can quickly change once Marshall Aid comes to an end. And then the Conservatives will know better than the Socialists how one handles public finances and can avert the danger.” 

</p>, <p>It will not be easy for Dartford's voters. For whom should they decide? For the experienced Socialist Dodds or the charming young lady from the solid middle class, who makes up in spirit for what she still lacks in experience? Margaret confidently hopes for a seat in Parliament— “and indeed on the side of the majority.” 

</p>, <p>At the last parliamentary election, when the count ended in the constituency of Dartford, the Returning Officer made known the following result: Conservative 16,951 votes, Labour Party 36,665 votes. The victorious Socialist candidate, who was thereby elected to Parliament for the first time, was Norman Dodds; and the same man is being put up as a candidate by his party this time. The strong athletic tradesman awaits things calmly: “If they want to have me, I'll return to Parliament,” he says. And he makes no secret of the fact that, in the event of his defeat, he can again take up his old management post with a co-operative retail society, where he would be better off than on a MP's allowance.

</p>, <p>As a convinced Socialist, who learnt in his youth all the needs of the industrial worker, he fully supports the domestic <span class="page">[end p2]</span> policy of the Labour Party; he does not always share Bevin's foreign policy views. “I know the Continent,” he often says when speaking to the people of Dartford, “and I was recently again in Germany. It is high time that Germany and Austria had a peace treaty … Western European union? We must powerfully support it, if it comes about—but I fear that is still a Utopia.” Since rationing in Germany has been abolished, Dodds is showered with questions about development in this country above all. “I was astonished by the shop-window displays in Munich and Hamburg,” relates the candidate, “and the healthy vigour with which the Germans are building up their country again seems to me to be a typical trait of their character. But they must not forget unemployment and the unjust distribution of the burden.” This argument is important to him, and with it he underlines the Socialist policy of the Labour Government.

</p>, <p>In his constituency, Dodds concerns himself especially with the creation of proper jobs for disabled ex-servicemen. “They should not have the feeling that they are receiving charity.” And he is proud of the 1,368 new houses which have been built in Dartford since the end of the war.

</p>, <p>Dodds has a flair for publicity. During his time in Parliament, he has used every means of advertising up to a helicopter in order to make the Labour Government popular, and he awaits polling day with quiet confidence. “The people of Dartford must now already know what they want,” he maintains. “If they want to elect the Conservatives, I can no longer do much about it.” As an Englishman and a sportsman—apart from his political work, he is also President of Dartford Football Club—he has a strong sense of fair play; and when the HEUTE-reporter asked him if he believed in his victory in Dartford, Norman Dodds simply answered, “If Miss Roberts won, there would certainly not be many Labour MPs in the new Parliament.” 

</p>, <p>In England, one votes, not for a party list, but for a person. Each constituency sends to the House of Commons that candidate who receives the most votes, even if he does not have an absolute majority. In order to deter hopeless applicants, <span class="page">[end p3]</span> every candidate has to put down a deposit of £150, which he loses if fewer than an eighth of the electors vote for him. The crucial element in the election campaign is personally making oneself known to the voters—in private conversations, in meetings and public debates with other candidates. The pictures on this page show Mr Dodds and Miss Roberts at one such debate. Both spiritedly put forward their standpoints, but even the most heated debate remains within the boundaries of good manners. Insults and slanders are forbidden by the electoral law. Even blasphemy is expressly mentioned among the forbidden utterances. The candidate will hardly feel hindered by that. Greater difficulties are caused for him by the regulations about election expenses: perhaps even a very rich candidate does not have the possiblilty of ‘bombarding’ the voter with unlimited propaganda through hundreds of thousands of posters, loud-speaker vans, newspaper advertisements, and countless other means. Precisely for that reason, the law places narrow limits on publicity expenditure: no candidate may spend more than £450 plus one and a half to two pennies for each voter in the constituency. In an average constituency that is about £1,000, from which hall rental, leaflets, travel costs, and other expenses must be paid. The candidate must verify these expenses with an accredited accountant. If he has exceeded the maximum amount, his election can be challenged.

</p>, <p></p>, <p></p>, <p></p>, <p></p>, <p>Considering that the slang name of the House of Commons is the Westminster Gasworks. A. P. Herbert 's last line should give the lie once and for all to those who say it is the women who do all the talking.

</p>, <p>Wanted—more women. More women in the House of Commons to see that women's rights are adequately defended; more women to take an active interest in local affairs; more women to apply their innate common sense to cut the cackle of politics and sort out the real questions that now face us before they vote.

</p>, <p>It is a mistake to try to segregate political affairs into those that concern men and those that concern women. Most decisions taken at Westminster involve all of us, directly or indirectly.

</p>, <p>Politics go further into our daily lives than ever before in Parliamentary history. That of course, is the reason why so many more people now take a greater interest in current affairs.

</p>, <p>Fifteen to 20 years ago most men and women provided they were left alone to pursue their own jobs and interests unbindered gave little thought to politics.

</p>, <p>But to-day, the Socialist Government interferes so much with the little things of daily life that the person who wants to win back the right to make more of his or her own decisions is forced into the political arena to fight against the present regime.

</p>, <p>Women are affected as much as, it not more than, the men, and are taking a more lively interest in politics.

</p>, <p>The welfare of her family is the prime concern of nearly every woman. Material things of course, form a large part of this, but it is the spiritual aspect that will eventually determine whether the home is happy. Neither factor can be neglected, so let us consider both.

</p>, <p>1—There is the job of getting a home to live in

</p>, <p>When there is a shortage, women aren't so much concerned with who shall build the houses—local authorities or private enterprise—as long as they go up at an economical price

</p>, <p> “Don't quibble about the whys and wherefores of permits; get the job done.” That is their practical attitude. “Throw everything you've got into the task without party prejudice, and the houses we so urgently need will go up more quickly.” 

</p>, <p>2—The family shopping. The task of feeding one's family and running the household is far harder than in pre-war years.

</p>, <p>Instead of doing the weekly shopping in one or two days, most women have to trudge down to town daily to queue for the odd pound of chocolate biscuits or sultanas that reaches the shops.

</p>, <p>It is not only the small quantity and monotony that troubles her but often the inferior quality of the foods she buys. The choice cuts of meat are not for the British housewife.

</p>, <p>More home-grown food must be the policy if we are to have more rations. Far better to spend a million on home agriculture than to say good-bye to £25 million on groundnuts.

</p>, <p>The Ministry of Food and Agriculture must work more closely together. This year, the English fruit farmers lost heavily when Mr. Strachey decided to import tons and tons of Continental fruit just as our own bumper crops matured. They were consequently left to rot upon the ground.

</p>, <p>All these mistakes are unnecessary, and infuriate women.

</p>, <p>A word about controls before we leave the subject of food. It is quite clearly stated in the Conservative policy that rationing of prime necessities will not be abolished while shortages persist. But, we ask, is everything being done to alleviate those shortages The answer is: NO.

</p>, <p>During the coming few weeks, one example of releasing a control will be thrown up again and again by the Socialists—namely, sweets.

</p>, <p> “There!” they will say. “You see what happens when we follow the Tories' advice and re-ration sweets.” 

</p>, <p>But the example is a solitary one. They followed the Tories' advice and released jam. Did that disappear from the market?

</p>, <p>Under great pressure, they followed the Tories' advice and released first shoes, then all clothes. Have they disappeared from the market? No. Their argument over sweets doesn't bear examination.

</p>, <p></p>, <p>Such are the achievements of Socialism at the Food Ministry.

</p>, <p>3—What of the spiritual side, the intangibles of politics, the love of freedom and honesty, the sanctity of the home?

</p>, <p>These qualities are fast disappearing, to the detriment of our home life and national character. Their loss is a source of grave concern to our womenfolk: they wonder what the future will hold for their children if only material values are to count.

</p>, <p>4—Women are intensely patriotic, and the loss of Britain's prestige under the present Government weighs heavily on their minds

</p>, <p>Foreign policy and the defence of the realm concerns them vitally, for in the event of war they are the first to be affected. They would like to feel that the destiny of our country is controlled by firm hands again.

</p>, <p>These are some of the things that will occupy the thoughts of women for the next few weeks. No one will try to underestimate the seriousness of the decision which lies before us.

</p>, <p>As there are 1,000,000 more women voters than men we have a special responsibility to bear. All parties are wanting to attract more women: in fact, women are the V.I.P.s of the moment. For once, the demand is great as the supply!

</p>, <p>Let us rise to our responsibilities, and if we want to see a strong independent Britain, let us go forward by the Right.</p>, <p>Copyright © Margaret Thatcher Foundation 2018. All Rights Reserved.
        </p>][<p id="section">Speeches, Interviews &amp; Other Statements</p>, <p id="description">Complete list of 8,000+ Thatcher statements &amp; texts of many of them</p>, <p class="mt">During the last General Election many people who had carefully read the propaganda and election addresses of the varous political candidates and Parties were heard to ask what was the difference between them? Such a barrage of leaflets and speeches will be put across during the next few weeks that the same thing may happen again unless we distil out the issues and keep the factors at stake ever before our minds.

</p>, <p>We will consider them under four headings: (1) Britain amongst the Nations; (2) Britain's Economic Independence; (3) Nationalisation or Private Enterprise; (4) Frustration or Freedom.

</p>, <p>Firstly, Britain amongst other nations. Where have we gone in the last five years? What have we lost? What has the name of Britain conjured up in the minds of friend and foe, in time past, and what does it mean now?

</p>, <p>The whole situation of our decline can be epitomised in one incident, that of the “Amethyst.” Her escape was indeed miraculous, the courage of her men unsurpassed; but have the British people stopped to think that the “Amethyst” should never have been in such a position? That not so very long ago when a British ship sailed between enemy ranks, both sides would have ceased firing on one another, and saluted her.

</p>, <p>Now she is treated with contempt and detained at the pleasure of another power. Such is our fall in the eyes of the world. And why, when it was our country and Commonwealth which fought for freedom in face of the force of a Dictator?

</p>, <p>No nation stood higher in the eyes of the world in 1945. We had the greatest opportunities for leadership a nation ever possessed, but we didn't take them.

</p>, <p><span class="nm">Winston Churchill</span>A prophetic voice urged us to co-operate more closely with Western Europe and with America in order to combine against Communism. But for two years his words fell on deaf ears until the initial opportunity was lost and we had to resort to his measures as expedients.

</p>, <p>Britain must be restored to her premier position as a nation and as the centre of an Empire. The world needs her.

</p>, <p>Are you going to let the decline continue under a further spell of the present regime, or are you going to put the nation's affairs in next door neighbour who had been to the wars and lost everything. You on the other hand had not had quite such a tough time and were still comparatively well placed.

</p>, <p>You would probably think it over and agree to allow him a generous loan over a period of four or five years to help him to get re-established. Now in the first place, wouldn't your confidence in him be shaken if the money ran out in eighteen months instead of the expected five years? That is what our American Loan did.

</p>, <p>But, nevertheless, perhaps like the Americans, you would be generous and offer to finance him for a further four years. Only this time you would review the position every year and make it clear that if he put his back into the work he would be independent when the four years were over.

</p>, <p>That is effectively what America said to us. But, after a further two years, the man next door is far from making ends meet. Even with all the help he is receiving, he is not making sufficient effort to keep himself and his family alive; in fact he is having to sell one or two pieces of his wife's gold jewellery to pay the grocer's bill.

</p>, <p>That is what what we are doing—having to sell our gold reserves to pay for our food.

</p>, <p>Now, how does our next door neighbour view all this? Does he say: “The situation is desperate, I'm not even paying my way and unless I really get down to it I and my family will starve” ?

</p>, <p>Or does he think to himself, “Well, the old blighter who is financing me would only have to pay far more in tax if he didn't let me have a lot of his cash, so he would suffer as well” ?

</p>, <p>What would be the reaction of the “old blighter” ? Would he meekly go on lending money or would he say “I've given enough help <span class="page">[end p1]</span> charge of Conservative men and women who will bring courage, firmness, and an unshakeable confidence into the realm of our foreign relations?

</p>, <p>You will decide.

</p>, <p>Secondly, our success both at home and abroad will depend on our ability to stand on our own financial feet and not to rely on the charity of a more powerful nation.

</p>, <p>We have come to accept the American Loan, followed by Marshall Aid far too easily, without really preparing ourselves for what will happen when we can no longer draw our weekly pension.

</p>, <p>There are those who argue that we shall inevitably run into difficulties which could only be made good by further grants of American dollars, and the United States would be the chief sufferer if these were not forthcoming.

</p>, <p>Such premises are unworthy of a proud race. In fact they are no more than wishful thinking.

</p>, <p>Supposing, to take an analogy, that in 1945 you were asked to finance your and if that chap can't stand on his own feet now, it's time he could; he won't get another cent out of me” ?

</p>, <p>Like him the American people are not going to help us indefinitely. Every American citizen contributes about £11 production per year to Marshall Aid, and the time will come in 1952 when they won't do it any more.

</p>, <p>Are YOU going to let this proud island race, who at one time would never accept charity, drift on from crisis to crisis under a further spell of shaky Socialist finance?

</p>, <p>Or do you believe in sound finance and economical spending of public money, such as the Conservatives will adopt?

</p>, <p>YOU will decide.

</p>, <p>Thirdly, do you want another stiff dose of nationalisation? You know the quality and price of present day coal compared with pre-war.

</p>, <p>Do you want cement to go up as much in price? That would make your already expensive house even dearer to build. It would mean the rent of Council houses rising again, and probably something slapped on the rates as well.

</p>, <p>Do you want your sugar to deteriorate in quality and the cost of its manufacture to increase?

</p>, <p>And how about steel; is the same thing to happen to that, affecting your houses, your cutlery, kitchen grates, etc.?

</p>, <p>Are you going to let the manufacturers whittle down the prices under the stimulus of Private Enterprise, or meekly pay more for nationalised goods?

</p>, <p>YOU will decide.

</p>, <p>And finally, what about our own individual lives; is it to be frustration or freedom?

</p>, <p>Last week I received a letter from a young unknown engineer from one of the Dominions who was on a visit to this country. He was so appalled by the restrictions on our peoples and the docile manner in which we accepted them, that he wrote to one of the younger Conservative prospective candidates urging her to put the position clearly before the electorate.

</p>, <p>The unknown writer said that we were not using our national abilities for which we are famed, our spirit of adventure, our initiative, our courage to tackle new projects, to best advantage.

</p>, <p>But we were submissively letting ourselves be ordered about by a <i>system</i>.

</p>, <p>Is this the fighting spirit which put us head and shoulders above other nations, he asked.

</p>, <p>It was not a Government that built up the skill and craft of this country—the woollen goods, the beautiful china, and the precision engineering, which have made their way into the markets of the world.

</p>, <p>It was private individuals who patiently persevered, building up their businesses bit by bit.

</p>, <p>They were not held up at every stage by having to apply to four or five different Ministries in triplicate. They and their families just went ahead with the job, living their own lives without interference.

</p>, <p>Their success provided employment for others and greatly benefited the community as a whole. This was the spirit that made England great and can restore her once again. Do you want it to perish for a soul-less Socialist system, or to live to recreate a glorious Britain?

</p>, <p>There were cheers when Mr. A. Morris Wheeler, president of the local branch of the Conservative Party, pinned on her a huge rosette and wished her “Good luck.” 

</p>, <p>Introducing Miss Roberts, Mr. Morris Wheeler referred to the dissolution of Parliament that day, and said he was a very happy man that night because he was not under Socialist rule. He was sorry to say that they now had a Liberal opponent in the Division, but he did not mind who came into the field, for the Conservatives had a policy. It was said they had a past to live down, but that was not so. He had been a Conservative from his 5s.-a-week days and he was very proud of the past of this country.

</p>, <p>Recommending them to adopt Miss Roberts as their candidate, Mr. J. Miller, chairman of the local Party, said that in the 11 months she had been among them, Miss Roberts had brought an extraordinary vigour and confidence, and in that time had done a tremendous lot. They were going into this election with better organisation, and more confidence and vigour than ever before.

</p>, <p>In her introductory remarks Miss Roberts said they did not need to go scouting round for candidates at the 11th hour. That night they were really going into battle, and it was one of the biggest battles this country had ever known—a battle between two ways of life, one which led inevitably to slavery and the other to freedom. “Our opponents like to try and make you believe,” went on Miss Roberts, “that Conservatism is a privilege of the few. But Conservatism conserves all that is great and best in our national heritage. What is one of the first tenets of Conservatism? It is that of national unity. We say one nation, not one class against another. You cannot build a great nation or a brotherhood of man by spreading envy or hatred.” 

</p>, <p>Miss Roberts said their policy was not built on envy or hatred, but on liberty for the individual man or woman. It was not their policy to suppress success; their policy was to encourage it and encourage energy and initiative, because that was needed. People must be allowed the opportunities they desired. In 1940 it was not the cry of nationalisation that made this country rise up and fight totalitarianism. It was the cry for freedom and liberty.

</p>, <p>One of the greatest charges against the Socialists was that they had devalued our national character. It was not Socialism that had made Great Britain great, which had made us the bastion of freedom and liberty, and our nationality the most respected in the world. “We need all the Nuffields we have got. We do not want to tax them out of existence, or where should we be?” exclaimed the candidate.

</p>, <p>Only by creating wealth could they spend it; that was something people often forgot. Socialism did not create anything new. One example of trying to create something new was the groundnut scheme. (Laughter).

</p>, <p>Miss Roberts told the audience that they would hear a lot of rot about the past record of the Conservative Party, but long before the Socialist Party existed, the Conservative Party was fighting for the betterment of men and women, such as the fight for the reduction of working hours of children and young people.

</p>, <p>There was one aspect in the election she was sorry to see happening—that was the attempt to smear the peace-time record of Mr. Winston Churchill. Among other things, with unemployment insurance and widows' and orphans' pensions, he had a magnificent record in the service of the people. “And we trust he will be able to put his services at the disposal of this country again very shortly. This smear campaign is actuated by envy and jealousy.” 

</p>, <p>For many years, she said, the Conservatives had been charged with not having a policy. That charge had now rounded upon the Labour Party because nowhere in their policy did they mention Marshall Aid. If that was not shirking the issue, she did not know what was. The Conservative policy, as stated in “This is the Road,” was ten times better than the Labour policy, and it did not shirk any measures they felt were necessary.

</p>, <p>Taxation, said Miss Roberts, should not be used to punish anyone who earned more than his neighbour. Successful people should not be penalised to give fair shares to those who did not work so hard as those who did. If they were unequal in their efforts, they should get unequal rewards, the only exceptions being those who were too old and too ill. The instrument of taxation had been wrongly used in the last four or five years.

</p>, <p> “People will not work harder unless they get extra rewards, she declared. “It is a great shame that the policy of Socialism is driving a great many of our decent men and women to do a bit ‘on the side’ to avoid taxation.” 

</p>, <p>Government expenditure was far too high at 40 per cent of the national income, and in claiming that the Ministries of Food and Agriculture should be one, she said last summer one was buying fruit from Italy while the other was trying to cope with a bumper crop at home. She could think of nothing more cheering to the heart and stomach of the house-wife than that Lord Woolton should get back.

</p>, <p>It was false to say that the Conservatives would cut pensions and family allowances. Their counter-accusation was that these had been shamefully decreased by the cost of living and the devaluation of the pound. As with food subsidies, that was something the Socialists would completely misrepresent.

</p>, <p> “Cut out bulk buying by the Ministry of Food,” she said. If that failed to reduce sufficiently the amount spent on subsidy, it might be necessary to cut down a little—but they should not get alarmed, for the cuts had already started. Meat had gone up in price. Fish had gone up in price. If it was necessary for the Conservatives to cut food subsidies, then it would not take place unless simultaneously with a reduction in taxation and an increase in pensions and allowances to those who could not afford to buy food if the price went up. If food subsidies were cut, an equivalent amount of money would be put in the hands of the people.

</p>, <p>Concluding with the slogan quoted above, Miss Roberts said they believed they could put a Government into power which would not be dominated by circumstances, but which would dominate the circumstances and bring the nation through.

</p>, <p>The adoption, moved by Mr. A. Hawker and seconded by Mrs. A. E. Young, was supported by Mrs. E. C. Botten, Mrs. A. Jenns, and Mr. J. F. Waterman.

</p>, <p>Miss Roberts began her campaign proper when she addressed open-air meetings on Saturday at Dartford, Crayford, and Erith.</p>, <p>Copyright © Margaret Thatcher Foundation 2018. All Rights Reserved.
        </p>][<p id="section">Speeches, Interviews &amp; Other Statements</p>, <p id="description">Complete list of 8,000+ Thatcher statements &amp; texts of many of them</p>, <p class="mt">I hope to meet you all personally meanwhile here is my policy—

</p>, <p>THE first task that awaits the new Government is that of setting the finances of the nation in order. Few people understand all the ‘in and outs’ of economics and national finances, but all of us know only too well that something is very seriously wrong with our country's economic position. We are at present receiving help from abroad, especially from our American friends, help which amounts to £1 per week for every household. This will end in 1952 and from then on we've got to support ourselves. The Socialist Election Manifesto makes no mention of American help at all, and therefore completely fails to face the economic situation, which is the essence of our livelihood. We Conservatives are not afraid to face the future whatever problem it entails, because it is our earnest desire to make Great Britain great again.

</p>, <p>This is not vote-catching, it is vital to the future output of our men and women. Why are so many people refusing to do even a small amount of overtime when it is so urgently needed? It is because the extra money they earn brings them up to a higher income-tax rate and by the time the Exchequer has taken its slice, the workman finds his overtime rate is less per hour than his normal rate. Consequently he refuses to do it, and Britain loses the production she vitally needs. That is why we propose a reduction in taxation, because we believe it would lead to greater output.

</p>, <p>What has Nationalisation meant to the householder and industrialist? Higher prices for lower quality. To the housewife it conjures up a picture of a grate full of dust, ash and clinker that won't burn. The better coal doesn't seem to exist any more. That is the gift of Nationalisation. And yet our opponents propose to Nationalise more industries. I ask every housewife, does she want her sugar to increase in price and go down in quality?—does she want cement which goes into building a house to go up in price, thereby increasing house building costs and rent? Never forget—a vote for the Socialists is a vote for Nationalisation of sugar, cement, iron and steel and threats to other industries as well. The alternative is Private Enterprise.

</p>, <p>Private Enterprise is producing the results. The export records we are breaking, and the goods that are at present buying our food and supplies from dollar countries, these are the work which Private Enterprise is doing NOW.

</p>, <p>The small shopkeepers are having a very raw deal at present. Socialism has no use for the small independent man and is doing all it can to crush him. I believe firmly that such men and women are part of the strength and backbone of England, and everything must be done to help them.

</p>, <p>A separate house for every family is our aim. We recognise this will take some time to achieve, but our complaint at present is that not all available resources have been used. If the private builders can put up houses faster than Local Authorities (and the Government's own report—the Girdwood Report—admitted they could), then we must use the private builders more. This is not the time for party prejudice, we require more houses at an economic price.

</p>, <p>It is our duty as a nation to remain strong to defend our ideals of British liberty, and those freedoms set forth in the Charter of the United Nations. It would be unwise at this time to end the principle of national service when we have so many defence commitments on our hands.

</p>, <p>Britain's prestige in the eyes of the world has gone down and down. I am certain that under the firm guidance that Conservatives can offer in this sphere, we can win it back. We are anxious to co-operate with all nations who are prepared to practice the democratic way of life.

</p>, <p>We are proud of the British Commonwealth and Empire. We believe it has a part to play in the future of the world. By its action in 1939 it saved the forces of freedom and democracy from extinction. We reaffirm the principle of Imperial Preference, believing that it will help both us and Empire peoples to solve our economic difficulties.

</p>, <p>We believe more food can be produced here in Britain. Far more good would have been done by spending one million pounds on home food production than nearly thirty million on ground nuts in East Africa. First place in the home market must be given to the British Farmer. Food rationing will not be abolished until sufficient supplies of necessities are within reach of every family. I should like to make one special point to the housewife. If Lord Woolton could feed us as he did during the war, when many ships were sunk by U-boats, and we could get no supplies from German-dominated Europe, don't you think we should be better fed now, when our ships can sail the seas freely and Europe can trade with us once again?

</p>, <p>Don't be misled by Socialist lies about Tory policy on this score. From what they say it would appear that Socialists are afraid of the future and are consequently trying to gain your votes by saying that we wish to create unemployment. Let's have this quite clear, the danger of unemployment arises not from the Tory Party, but from inability to earn enough to buy the raw materials we need, to keep our men at work. At present a considerable part of these materials is provided by American Aid and as noted above, the Socialists haven't dared to mention what will happen when this comes to an end. We have, and we accept it as the duty of any Government that it should do everything possible to maintain a high and stable level of employment.

</p>, <p>FINALLY, I should like to send a personal message to all Electors. No Candidate can promise a Utopia just by voting this way or that. The long training I have received has taught me to shape my own opinions judging on the evidence alone. I promise to consider all matters of policy in this light, and in Parliament I should vote as my conscience and not party line dictates. I should carry out my task to the utmost of my ability, allowing myself no rest until the duties which fell to my lot were complete.

        </p>][<p id="section">Speeches, Interviews &amp; Other Statements</p>, <p id="description">Complete list of 8,000+ Thatcher statements &amp; texts of many of them</p>, <p class="mt">In 1945 Bevin declared “Russia would deal better and with greater confidence with a Labour Government.” To-day, after nearly five years of Socialist Government, British Relations with Russia are more dangerously strained than at any time in the present century. Now the only constructive proposal for restoring friendly relations comes from Churchill, who says it is time we had fresh talks at the highest level. This had caused the Socialists to squeal because they hadn't thought of it.

</p>, <p>Compared with 1945 when the Socialists came into power money buys less, in fact £1 now only buys 16s. 4d. worth of goods. That is what the government of the past 5 years has done for us. This lowering of the £1 has hit the lowest incomes hardest, especially the pensioners. If returned the Socialists won't change their extravagant ways and prices will still rise. Send back a Conservative Government with its policy of reducing prices and the cost of living.

</p>, <p>In 1929 the Labour Party were returned to office claiming to have a cure for unemployment, but nevertheless unemployment rose under their administration by 1½ million people, proving that they didn't have the answer to the problem. Without American Aid there would NOW be 1½–2 million unemployed, so it is capitalism we have to thank for help. American Aid ends at the latest in 1952. What then? We must have a change of policy now before the crisis is on us.

</p>, <p>There are now more people on Housing Lists than there were in 1945. While the Socialists often compare the rate of house building with the rate after the last war they forget two things:

</p>, <p>1. That the coalition government made many preparations for new houses before the war was over, because they had learned the lessons of the last post-war period; and,

</p>, <p>2. That after the 14–18 war housing was in charge of a Socialist, Dr. Addison. who was eventually dismissed for incompetence.

</p>, <p>Now in spite of all the special preparations that were made, houses are only being built half as fast as under the Tories in the late thirties and this is not fast enough.

</p>, <p>When Beveridge first wrote his report on the Social Services during the war, he mentioned something the Socialists often forget, namely, that our Social Services were not surpassed and hardly rivalled by any other country at that time. That was before the Socialist Government.

</p>, <p>Things like Old Age Pensions. Unemployment. Insurance. Widows' Pensions. Special School Meals. Milk Schemes, were all in existence long before the Socialist Government.

</p>, <p>Tories are not against planning when it is good. The trouble with the Socialists is that they often had no plan. Consequently we had a fuel crisis in 1947, a financial crisis the same year, when the American Loan ran out, and finally we had Devaluation. We have yet to feel the effect of this last step. Socialist planning takes us from one crisis to the next, saved only from collapse by a capitalist country like America—in fact they've had no sound plan to get us out of our economic difficulties at all and moreover they haven't got one now. Vote Conservative and save the nation while there is still time.

</p>, <p>A vote for the Socialist is a vote for further Nationalisation. Remember what Ian Mikardo said at the Oxford University Labour Club. He warned his Labour audience that it was not nationalisation that would attract voters into the Labour Party. They should rather be tempted by promises of improved Social Services. Then once they were in they would vote and argue for steel nationalisation even though they didn't know the first thing about it! That is the way the Labour Party is trying to pull the wool over your eyes about the disastrous effects of Nationalisation.

</p>, <p>She devoted a large part of her address to unemployment, and asserted but for Marshall Aid the raising of the school age, conscription, and the colossal increase in Ministry staffs, this country would have been faced with an unemployment figure of about 3,000,000.

</p>, <p>Mr. L. Gordon Waterman presided.

</p>, <p>Dealing with a few of the points in the Tory policy, Miss Roberts said there was nothing insincere in it. They had not given in it any promises or pledges which they felt unable to carry out, and any promises given in it would most certainly be carried out.

</p>, <p>Referring to Socialist propaganda about the health of the nation, she said that longer life enjoyed to-day was not due to the last Government getting into power. That, and the reduced infant mortality rate, for instance, was not related to the political colour of the Government in power, but to the research work which was being continually carried on. If the last Government was going to take the credit for medical advances, then they should also take the discredit of more people dying from cancer.

</p>, <p> “We have been very grossly misrepresented on the question of unemployment,” continued Miss Roberts. “You will undoubtedly hear the accusation that the Tories wish to create a pool of unemployed. It is quite illogical when you compare that propaganda with their other propoganda that the Tories are vote-catching. We have never wanted to create unemployment. Our policy is to maintain full employment. In the world-wide depression between the wars this country had to recover from it without American aid. Do you think any Tory boss is going to cry, ‘Hurrah for a depression; look at the money I'm going to lose’?” 

</p>, <p>Miss Roberts said that unemployment under a Tory Government had always been lower when it left office than when it entered office, In 1944 the Coalition Government, of which the Tories were the largest party, produced a White Paper in which they said there would be no problem of general unemployment in the years immediately after the end of the war, but where we were tripping up now was that we were finding that other countries were producing more things cheaper than we were. What were we going to do when American aid ended in 1952? Where were we to get the money to buy our raw materials?

</p>, <p>We had an American loan which was supposed to last until 1950, but unfortunately, due to a gentleman called Dr. Dalton, it ran out in 18 months. Nevertheless, America granted us further aid, but she was quite certain it would not happen again. We were still not managing to make ends meet, not only on our own money, but on the money America gave us.

</p>, <p>Socialist Ministers Sir Stafford Cripps, Mr. Herbert Morrison and Mr. Aneurin Bevan had admitted that without American aid there would have been from 1,500,000 to 2,000,000 unemployed. One would have thought that the first thing that would have sprung to their minds would have been—what are we going to do to face the crisis in 1952, when Marshall Aid ends? The Tories mentioned it in their manifesto as one of their first items. They would not find a word in the Socialist manifesto.

</p>, <p>Miss Roberts said they would not take all controls off food until the premier necessities were in reach of every family. After all, it was Lord Woolton who put controls on when it was necessary and gave them the finest rationing system in the world.

</p>, <p>Control on house building should be relaxed. A builder who had heard her talk about this had told her yesterday that if this was done he could build 16 houses immediately, houses of brick and mortar costing £1,200—£1,400. A pre-fab to-day was costing about £1,200.

</p>, <p>At question-time the candidate, asked if the suggested economies in the Festival of Britain, etc., would not create unemployment, replied, “So long as you have got a colossal shortage of houses, it would have been better to divert the labour force from the Festival of Britain and put it on houses.” 

</p>, <p>Questioned on the National Health Service, the candidate said that a slightly different scheme would have come into operation under the Conservatives. It would have been a bit more gradual instead of trying to do everything at once. There would have been a better system of priority for those needing urgent attention.

</p>, <p>Asked about food subsidies, she said there would be no reduction which might influence the price of food without compensating increases to those most affected. These compensations would take the form on the one hand of larger family allowances, pensions and other social benefits, and on the other of reductions of taxation, direct and indirect, that would increase incentives among the masses of the people. The present system was indiscriminate. Was it fair that the poor man's tobacco and beer should be used to help to pay for the rich man's food?</p>, <p>Copyright © Margaret Thatcher Foundation 2018.

</p>, <p>It was said that steel, cement and sugar should be nationalised because they were monopolies. That was not so, but there was an answer to that argument, she said. If they were monopolies, why make them bigger monopolies by putting them under Government ownership?

</p>, <p>The steel industry had not had a major strike for 30 years, so it did seem clear that the employees were by no means dissatisfied. Similarly, cement and sugar were highly effective industries. Nationalisation, she told them, had never vet succeeded in reducing prices.

</p>, <p>Questioned as to the Conservative policy on industries already nationalised, Miss Roberts said they would be prepared to sell back to free enterprise those sections of the road haulage industry which had already been nationalised, and to restore the former system of A and B licences. As wide a free enterprise as possible would be restored to civil aviation. The coal industry would be reorganised as a public undertaking and the work of the National Board would be decentralised, as would the railways, to give greater responsibility to men on the spot.</p>, <p>Copyright © Margaret Thatcher Foundation 2018.

</p>, <p>Mr. Hadyn Fletcher presided.

</p>, <p>The basic difference between the Conservative and Socialist outlooks, said Lord Balfour, was this—that the Socialists believed in the State as the supreme authority, and the individual had to be subservient to the State; that the State knew best and that the citizen was the servant of the State. The Conservative view-point was quite the opposite. It was that the State should be the servant of the individual.

</p>, <p>The old idea that you could tax the rich to make the poor richer had gone; there were no more golden hen-roosts to be robbed. It was only by prosperous industry that they could succeed.

</p>, <p> “Socialists believe passionately in nationalisation” went on Lord Balfour. “We reject absolutely the conception that industry in this country can compete with the world's markets under nationalisation.

</p>, <p>The losses on nationalised industries were piling up Lord Balfour went on. If the Conservatives were returned they would not be able to unscramble the omelettes the Socialists had made in coal, electricity, railways, and gas, but they would be able to decentralise control away from Whitehall. They would call a halt to any more nationalisation.

</p>, <p>The Conservatives accepted the profit-motive— “and don't let us be mealy mouthed about it,” he said. Profit was something desirable, it satisfied the human need, and should be encouraged. There should be rewards for extra effort from the humblest to the top.

</p>, <p>The Labour Ministers were trying to take all the credit for the fact that unemployment had been low since the war, but the Socialist Party had been in power in a seller's market. To-day, a man's job depended on whether his industry could compete at home and abroad with the goods of competitive nations.

</p>, <p>Lord Balfour said they would retain controls on all goods in short supply; that was a definite pledge. What they would not do was to continue controls for control's sake and political policy. To-day there were 12,000 enforcement officers belonging to 18 different Government departments who might look into people's cupboards, and that meant that the Englishman's home was no longer his castle. The Conservatives were determined to get rid of “mumbo-jumbo” and to see that they were once more free citizens, he declared.

</p>, <p>When Miss Roberts rose to speak she was greeted by a shout of “Good old Margaret!” Pointing to the Union Jack covering the table, Miss Roberts said they always had the flag at their meetings because they were very proud of their country and of the people in it.

</p>, <p> “We cannot do without the talent and ability that is latent in this country” declared Miss Roberts. “Unless you keep the policy of extra rewards for extra work and extra skill you will never better things.” 

</p>, <p>Referring to trade unions, the candidate said there were perhaps many there who did not attend their union meetings very often. Communists went frequently to the meetings, and that was how they came to control unions and put forward block votes with which many members did not agree. Only 19 attended the last meeting of a local branch of a union out of 50 members. Conservatives, she claimed, believed strongly in trade unions, and had granted the right to strike and to arbitration.

</p>, <p>Miss Roberts said the Conservatives believed in the maintenance of Imperial preference to help get this country out of its economic mess. They condemned the Government for not consulting the Empire over the devaluation of the £ and the recognition of China.

</p>, <p>The first questioner asked why, if the Socialists stood for equality, Mr. Attlee got £10,000 a year?

</p>, <p>Lord Balfour: Actually, he gets £10,000 as Prime Minister and, I think, another £10,000 as expenses …

</p>, <p>A voice: What about Churchill?

</p>, <p>Lord Balfour: As Leader of the Opposition, he can get £2,000 a year. Mr. Churchill has not drawn that since he has been Leader of the Opposition.</p>, <p>Copyright © Margaret Thatcher Foundation 2018. All Rights Reserved.

Mr. Haydn Fletcher again presided.

</p>, <p>Referring to steel, she said its output was breaking all records. Its exports were all right. How were its labour relations? No labour strike for 30 years. It was a record of which the steel industry could be very proud. The price of steel was lower than anywhere else in the world, except Australia. In wages there were incentives for the workers. Where was the argument that the industry was inefficient or unfair? Why should the country take it over?

</p>, <p> “It is private enterprise that made us what we were” she concluded, “We believe private enterprise can take us on to greater heights. It will sound the death-knell of the nation if we take one further step into nationalisation.”

<span class="comment">(2) <i>Graresend and Dartford Reporter</i>, 18 February 1950:</span> <span class="page">[end p1]</span> </p>, <p class="nonmt"> “We believe private enterprise can take us to greater heights. We believe it will sound the death knell of the nation if we take one further step into nationalisation.” 

</p>, <p>So said Dartford Conservative candidate Margaret Roberts at a packed meeting in the Church Hall on Friday evening. A mixed audience gave her a quiet hearing.

</p>, <p>Nationalisation— “one of the central issues between ourselves and the other side” —was the main theme of Miss Roberts' challenging speech.

</p>, <p> “I am interested to notice,” she remarked, “that it is not called nationalisation so much now. It has become socialisation or mutualisation. But it is still the same thing. It is still complete state ownership. It is still the fundamental tenet, still the central theme, of Socialism.” 

</p>, <p>Miss Roberts said she was not going to talk very much about the things that had already been nationalised. She wanted to talk more about the issues of the present election—whether the country should carry on with further nationalisation. The things she was particularly concerned with were steel, cement and sugar.

</p>, <p>Taking steel first, the candidate reminded her audience that it was breaking all records. Its output was higher than ever before.

</p>, <p> “And it is breaking all records,” she emphasised, “not with a greater labour force than in pre-war days but with virtually the same, so that output per man has gone up considerably—and that at a time when output per man in other industries is not as satisfactory as it might be.” 

</p>, <p>What about the industry's labour relations? There had been no major strike for 30 years. That was a tremendous record—one of which the steel industry could be very proud indeed.

</p>, <p>How about prices? They were lower than anywhere else in the world except Australia.

</p>, <p>Steel was one of the most efficient industries in the country at the present time. Its record was abundantly proving that. Why then should the Government take it over? There was no reason except for sheer party lines. There was no argument at all for nationalising steel that could not be answered from the record books and facts which the industry had.

</p>, <p>Turning to cement, Miss Roberts said it was something which particularly interested the Dartford Division—for the amount of dust they got, if not for the product itself.

</p>, <p>Cement was a smaller industry than steel, of course, but let them take a look at the output figures. Cement was the only one of our industries where the output per man in this country was greater than the output per man in America.

</p>, <p> “That says a tremendous lot for British know-how,” Miss Roberts commented.

</p>, <p>Referring to the profit-sharing and bonus and pensions schemes associated with the cement industry, the candidate said most of her audience well knew what happened to the co-partnership and profit-sharing schemes in the gas industry when that was nationalised. Many cement workers were asking if the same thing would happen to them if their industry was nationalised.

</p>, <p>After discussing sugar, Miss Roberts appealed to her hearers not to allow wool to be pulled over their eves by Socialist boasts of a planned economy.

</p>, <p>The function of a Government, she said, was not to take over every mortal thing in the country's economy. Its function was to let the ordinary people get on with the job as far as they could.

</p>, <p> “Private enterprise has made us what we are—a great industrial nation,” Miss Roberts declared. “I do not believe we should be anything like as great if we had had a 100 years of Socialism. It was private enterprise which made us what we are and gave our people one of the highest standards of living in the world.” </p>, <p>Copyright © Margaret Thatcher Foundation 2018.

        </p>][<p id="section">Speeches, Interviews &amp; Other Statements</p>, <p id="description">Complete list of 8,000+ Thatcher statements &amp; texts of many of them</p>, <p class="nonmt">Feature of the week's campaign by Miss Margaret Roberts, Conservative candidate in Dartford Division, has been the intense interest taken in her meetings.

</p>, <p>At the close of one crowded meeting, which subjected her to some mild “heckling,” . she thanked the “opposition” supporters for turning up in such large numbers and so helping her meetings to avoid getting the reputation of those of her opponents—that they were “as dead as mutton.” (Laughter)

</p>, <p>Well over 300 crowded into the hall of Electricity House, Erith, on Monday evening to hear the Conservative candidate.

</p>, <p>Mr. J. F. L. Gates presided.

</p>, <p>In her address, Miss Roberts touched on the question of food, and said there had been a considerable amount of distortion regarding the abolition of food rationing in Germany. She would therefore read the following letter received from an English-woman Mrs. Irene Hebershon) in Kiel:

</p>, <p> “In view of the statements which Dr. Summerskill has been making on the question of German derationing, I feel that somebody ought to refute these without delay. First of all, the mark is worth roughly one shilling to the Germans, and the prices which Dr. Summerskill has quoted are these which the unfortunate British have to pay in terms of the devalued £.

</p>, <p> “In one account which I read she is quoted as saying that meat here costs 4s. per lb.” That is nonsense. The most expensive joints of pork are marks 2.30 a 1b., which is equivalent to 2s. 4d. to the Germans, and other meat is considerably cheaper.

</p>, <p> “Then, as to the ability of Germans to buy enough food on their wages, I have talked to all types of workers, and they all say the same—that on their wages they are able to live very comfortably, and that the price of food has come down rapidly from the moment that the end of rationing was obviously in sight. The price of clothes and shoes is half what it was last year. …

</p>, <p> “A car driver earns with overtime 300 marks a month nett, after deduction of, roughly, 10 per cent. for taxes. When asked whether on this wage he could afford to buy meat for his family, he remarked that he and his wife and two children always had between them 21b. of meat on a Sunday, and that they had meat several times in the week as well.

</p>, <p> “You can buy two large pork chops for 1.40 marks (roughly, 1s. 5d.),” continued the writer, “and pork has been unrationed since the end of November. Sugar which is the only article still rationed, is, even so, 3lb. Per head per month, compared with our 2lb.” .

</p>, <p>Miss Roberts, however, said she wanted to make it clear that the Conservatives were not advocating derationing in this country until there was adequate food within reach of all at a reasonable price. But she would say this—they had every confidence in Lord Woolton's ability to cope with the situation.</p>, <p>Miss Roberts devoted her speech largely to three crises which she declared existed—(1) the economic crises, (2) the worldwide crises brought about by the possibilities of the hydrogen bomb, (3) the crises of individual liberty.

</p>, <p>Sometimes, she thought, we had heard so much about the economic crises that we did not realise its intensity. She would repeat—that if we could not stand on our own feet in 1952 (when Marshall Aid ends) then we were in for the greatest depression we had ever known.

</p>, <p>The crises of the H-bomb could only be solved on a world basis. If there existed in the world nations which had the idea of aggression, then we as one of the freedom-loving nations could give no absolute assurance as to the future of the world. It was said that it took two to make a quarrel; it also took two to make friends. Until we could achieve the goal set out in the United Nations Organisation, we had to co-operate with people of like minds and like ideals.

</p>, <p>The third crises—what she called the home front crises— was a crises of political philosophies, a crises of individual liberty. They would have measures being put through which looked so reasonable on the surface but underneath were the most pernicious, and nibbled into our national life and character far further than one would be aware of at first glance.

</p>, <p>Recalling what her father had said about the bird in the cage, Miss Roberts concluded: “It has social security. It has food and it has warmth, and so on. But what is the good of all that if it has not the freedom to fly out and live its own life?” 

</p>, <p>At question-time a heckler asked if Miss Roberts could tell him any time during the Conservayive reign when the working-class of this country was better fed and in better condition than it was to-day.

</p>, <p>In a lengthy reply, Miss Roberts said the protein content of food was far too low. They were making up with starchy and floury food. More people became run down.

</p>, <p>When another heckler shouted, “What about petrol?” Miss Roberts retorted, “I am quite certain that your Government was going to make an announcement about petrol, and Mr. Churchill got in first. You…Ministers are speaking about it with two voices, and these two voices do not say the same thing.” 

</p>, <p>To questions about post-war credits, Miss Roberts said she could not offer many optomistic hopes that they would get them immediately on the return of a Conservative Government. Such large sums were outstanding that it would be impossible to repay them all at once without risk of inflation. Meanwhile, they would consider schemes for the repayment of credits to the estates of deceased persons.

</p>, <p>Asked about housing, Miss Roberts said the Conservative accusation was that not all the resources available had been used, and they had very good grounds for saying that. In 1947 a Socialist Government committee found that a private builder could build four houses in the time a local authority built three.

</p>, <p> “For heaven's sake,” she declared, “let the private builder get on with it. Only limit the limit the size and the price.” On the contrary, the Government said that for every four houses the local authority completed the private builder could only build one. Now it had been reduced even further to one in ten.&amp;cqq

</p>, <p>A woman in the hall interrupted to tell the audience of her efforts over the last four years to get a Council house at Crayford as her boy and girl had to sleep in a small boxroom. I was told the only alternative was to have another baby.” 

</p>, <p>Miss Roberts thanked the woman for giving “a perfect illustration” of the restriction of human liberty.</p>, <p>Copyright © Margaret Thatcher Foundation 2018. All Rights Reserved.
        </p>][<p id="section">Speeches, Interviews &amp; Other Statements</p>, <p id="description">Complete list of 8,000+ Thatcher statements &amp; texts of many of them</p>, <p class="nonmt">A closing wrangle between two women in the audience enlivened the proceedings in St. Alban's Hall Dartford, on February 14, when Miss Roberts, the Conservative candidate, said that improvement in health had been gradual over many years. It was completely dishonest for politicians to use such improvement for Party ends.

</p>, <p>Propaganda about the abolition of food subsidies was complete distortion, too, she said and pointed out that the tax we paid on tobacco, beer, and many purchases subsidised the bread roll on the plate of the rich. That was one of the things that was keeping up the level of subsidies. The enormous figure of £450,000,000 had to be cut down and one of the ways was to cut out bulk buying.

</p>, <p>Miss Roberts said they should not run away with the idea that food was so highly priced in Germany that the ordinary worker could not afford to buy it; but, she pointed out, certain things, as they were there, were rationed by the purse in this country under a Socialist Government. They also had to consider that Germany was an ex-defeated enemy.

</p>, <p> “During the war,” she declared, “we were fed by Lord Woolton in the face of U-boat attacks and the fact that we could not draw supplies from the greater part of Europe. Many think that since the end of the war, with no U-boat attacks and with most of Europe to draw on, the improvement of our food supplies has not been good enough.” 

</p>, <p>At question-time a woman asked if de-rationing came to this country the average working could afford to pay for more than their rations? Miss Roberts repeated that she was not advocating de-rationing in this country until there were sufficient supplies. She had been trying to counteract distortion about Germany.

</p>, <p>Another question about food in Germany was answered from the floor of the hall by a man who jumped up and shouted “I was in Germany a short time ago and I can assure you that peasants were buying all the meat they wanted. I proved that with my own eyes.” 

</p>, <p>Another question asked the view of the Conservative policy to lift restrictions on private building of houses, what weekly repayments was necessary on a bought house, and how many people in the hall could afford such repayments?

</p>, <p>Part of the question was answered by Mr. John Miller, who was on the platform, and who aid that he had some land in Gravesend on which he had hoped to build 68 houses. It had taken him 2½ years to licences for eight of these, which he was now building.

</p>, <p>Miss Roberts, quoting one building society figures, said £1000 was repayable over 25 years at £1 4s. and 7½d. per week. There were many people waiting for Council houses, she said, who could afford and wanted to buy a house. If they let them build, then they were relieving the pressure on Council houses.

</p>, <p>Asked about National Liberals and the election, Miss Roberts explained their breakaway from the old Liberal Party, and said theat, as a Conservative and National Liberal philosophies and ideals were so close to one another they did not oppose each other.</p>, <p>Copyright © Margaret Thatcher Foundation 2018.

        </p>][<p id="section">Speeches, Interviews &amp; Other Statements</p>, <p id="description">Complete list of 8,000+ Thatcher statements &amp; texts of many of them</p>, <p class="nonmt">Speaking at Crayford County Secondary School for Girls on February 15, Miss Roberts replied to a statement that they had given more to Europe than they had received in Marshall Aid. They had given nothing like what they had received, she said. The European figure had been bolstered up with sterling balances, surplus military stores allowed to remain in Europe, and the cost of administration of the Italian colonies.

</p>, <p>Dealing with the H-bomb and the fear in everyone's mind of another war, she commended to them Mr. Churchill 's statement that now was the time to make another approach to Russia at top level. She hoped that on February 23 they would put that approach in his hands, because she thought he was the most likely person to preserve the peace.

</p>, <p>Going on to private enterprise, Miss Roberts said that under nationalisation a man could not build up a new factory on his own. If he had an idea, he had to sell it to the State and the State only.

</p>, <p> “You cannot have the dream of building up your own fortune by your own fortune by your own hopes, your own hands, and your own British guts” she declared. “That is one of the worst aspects of nationalisation.

</p>, <p> “Whenever an industry is nationalised, you do not have the safeguard of competition. If a nationalised industry is losing, all it has to do is to put up the price sufficiently high. If you are inefficient in private industry, you soon go out of business,” she said.

</p>, <p>Because the sound of the word nationalisation “stinks” nowadays, said Miss Roberts, the proposed nationalisation of insurance had been changed to “mutualisation.” But the real reason for the Socialists taking over insurance was to get their hands on the policy-holders' money for madcap schemes like groundnuts.

</p>, <p>The Socialist Government, she said, could not deny some responsibility for the way the first American loan had run out in 18 months. She remembered that crisis very well, for she was looking for a job at the time. Now again they were exactly like a family which could not make ends meet. When Marshall Aid ended in 1952, what then? If this Government had come to a state when it could not live without aid from another capitalist country, then it had indeed lost the national character of the nation. All that the Socialist policy had brought them to was one financial crisis after another—and now devaluation.</p>, <p>Copyright © Margaret Thatcher Foundation 2018. All Rights Reserved.
        </p>][<p id="section">Speeches, Interviews &amp; Other Statements</p>, <p id="description">Complete list of 8,000+ Thatcher statements &amp; texts of many of them</p>, <p class="nonmt">Miss Roberts told electors at Dartford East County Secondary School for Boys on Friday that, so far as devaluation was concerned, they still had to feel the full effects of the cuts. Most of the cuts would not take effect until after the election. They now had to pay more for goods from America.

</p>, <p> “Where I accuse the Government of dishonesty in this” she went on, “is that on September 18 Sir Stafford Cripps said the only immediate increase would be in the price of bread. That was quite wrong. The very next day the price of non-ferrous metals went up to the many manufacturers using them. It was the financial policy of the Government which took us to devaluation. The value of wages is not the actual amount in the wage-packet, but it is what that amount will buy in terms of goods,” said the candidate.

</p>, <p>In another two years' time, said Miss Roberts, that financial policy would bring them to the greatest unemployment problem they had ever known. Unless they improved their economic position and reduced the level of taxation, it would only bring them to further devaluation. They were the most highly taxed nation in the world. The basic fact of human nature was this—that if you wanted people to work and give extra work, then you had got to give extra rewards. At present, taxation obscured all that.</p>, <p>Copyright © Margaret Thatcher Foundation 2018. All Rights Reserved.
        </p>][<p id="section">Speeches, Interviews &amp; Other Statements</p>, <p id="description">Complete list of 8,000+ Thatcher statements &amp; texts of many of them</p>, <p class="nonmt">Housing has loomed large at the meetings of Miss Margaret Roberts, Conservative candidate for the Dartford Division, and there was some uproar at Belvedere from the “opposition” when a questioner declared he had been disillusioned by the Socialists' promises.

</p>, <p> “You people who have got a house,” retorted Miss Roberts, amid counter-cheers, “should listen to someone who hasn't.” 

</p>, <p>Of the Liberals, Miss Roberts said the Conservatives did not have to wait for an election to realise the danger to personal liberty and put up a candidate at the last moment. If Liberals valued that individual liberty, the Conservatives asked, and indeed expected, that they would vote for the Conservatives, who had been fighting for this in the constituency, and not suddenly come in at the last moment.

</p>, <p>The storm over housing came at St. Augustine's County Primary School, Belvedere, on Monday, when the doors had to be closed before the meeting began and while there was still a queue outside.

</p>, <p>At question-time a man asked: “What are the Conservatives going to do about houses? I am apart from my family, and I have been sadly disillusioned since I came out of the Forces. What are the Conservatives going to do about the mess, for it is a mess. They promised us houses. I am still waiting …” 

</p>, <p>Amid some uproar from the back of the hall, the chairman (Mr. J. W. Panton) said, “Our Socialist friends are very touchy about housing. We will put that right for you.” 

</p>, <p>When order was restored, Miss Roberts told the questioner that the policy should have been to put every available man on the job. They must let the private builder build, and build as fast as he could, and so ease the pressure on the housing lists.

</p>, <p>In her address, Miss Roberts said there was one great difference between the way this election was being fought and the way in which the 1945 election was fought. In 1945 the whole cry was, “Let us face the future.” This time it was “Let us plug the past.” The Socialist Party, she declared, had no policy for the future, as indeed its manifesto showed. Whatever side got back—and she hoped and trusted it was the Conservatives then in six or eight weeks' time they had got to formulate the Budget, which would set the tone for the financial policy of the coming Government.

</p>, <p>They could not establish sound security on borrowed money. All parties were agreed that, but for overseas aid, their standard of living, so far as jobs and food were concerned, would be very much worse than it was to-day. They had been unable to make ends meet by their own efforts. “We have been using savings,” she went on, “and you can only use savings once, When they have gone, they have gone for good.” 

</p>, <p>They had already been told ployment.<i>[sic]</i>
</p>, <p>The Conservatives, she said, would cut out bulk buying, which would lower the prices of raw materials and also put quality up. With this, production had to go up, and in this they could not ignore the factors of human nature—that people worked for the ordinary things of life—perhaps to have a better house, perhaps to have a higher standard of living, perhaps to enjoy more consumer goods, perhaps to get a new television set, perhaps to give their children a better start in life.

</p>, <p>But increased reward for increased work must be the basis of any policy for increased production. The present level of taxation had obscured all that.

</p>, <p>They were the highest taxed nation in the world, and the Conservatives believed that this was having a very serious effect on output. The Chancellor of the <span class="nm">Sir Stafford Cripps</span>Exchequer must not take such a large slice out of the national income.

</p>, <p>Miss Roberts declared that other savings could be made in overheads by cutting controls, which would release many people for work on productive industry, which was crying out for them. The complex system of licences and permits often cut across each other and one was often the direct negation of the other. How could people in a central office know many of the details which had to be coped with many miles away in a particular industry?

</p>, <p> “If prices come down by these means,” said Miss Roberts, “the demand for goods abroad will go up and you will not be faced with this dangerous situation in 1952. There are still two years to do it, but if the policy of the last 4½ years is continued, then we shall have merely a continuation of the economic crises as we have had—a major fuel crisis, a major crisis when the American loan ran out, then devaluation.

</p>, <p>When a point on the new Rating Act was raised at questiontime, Miss Roberts replied that the Act “will be reviewed when we get back to Parliament.” 

</p>, <p>On the question of political levies in trade unions, Miss Roberts said the first thing the Conservatives would do would be to have a round-table conference with the trade unions.</p>, <p>Copyright © Margaret Thatcher Foundation 2018. All Rights Reserved.
        </p>][<p id="section">Speeches, Interviews &amp; Other Statements</p>, <p id="description">Complete list of 8,000+ Thatcher statements &amp; texts of many of them</p>, <p class="nonmt">As the first stroke of nine reverberated across the river on Friday morning, the police officer standing in the shadow of Big Ben clock tower was approached by Mr. Norman Dodds, re-elected Member of Parliament for Dartford.

</p>, <p>Mr. Dodds was leading a delegation of members of the Dartford branch of U.N.A., including the Mayor (Councillor Mrs. Flora Welch), the chairman (Mr. W. G. Phillips), and the hon. secretary (Mrs. T. Dalby). A letter containing a question addressed to the Prime Minister dealing with the outlawing of the hydrogen bomb was handed to the officer by the Mayor.

</p>, <p>At 2.30 the same morning Mr. Dodds had been declared elected with a majority of 13,638 votes.

</p>, <p>He immediately expressed the belief that he would have the support of all people in the borough, irrespective of politics or religion, in submitting for inclusion at the first question-time in the newly-elected House the following question:—

</p>, <p> “Mr. Dodds—to ask the Prime Minister if he is aware of the passionate desire of the people that he should take the initiative in endeavouring to call a conference with the object of finding ways and means of outlawing the hydrogen bomb and atomic weapons.” 

</p>, <p>After delivering the letter the delegation went to U.N.A. Headquarters at Maiden-lane, W.C., where they saw the secretary (Mr. C. J. Judd), who was delighted with the effort Dartford U.N.A. were making on a subject in which public opinion had to be roused.

</p>, <p>The Mayor will call a meeting of all Churches, organisations, business houses, etc., to discuss the possibility of holding a large meeting on the subject in the future.

</p>, <p>The count took place at Dartford Grammar School and a crowd of about 100 was eagerly waiting when the result was declared at 2.30 a.m. as follows:—

</p>, <p></p>, <p>Previously, inside the hall, the three candidates shook hands after a few introductory remarks from the Mayor of Dartford and Mr. Dodds said how pleased he was that it was the Mayor's lot to make such an important announcement.

</p>, <p> “I would like to say to Mr. Armstrong (Town Clerk of Dartford) and his staff that I am sure the other candidates will agree with me that the work has been carried out efficiently and with great courtesy,” he added.

</p>, <p>Of the police, Mr. Dodds said that generally they were a great comfort to people inside the polling booths and he congratulated them on the able way they had carried out their duties.

</p>, <p>He thought both of his opponents had put up a marvellous show.

</p>, <p> “I think there is no difference in the amount of sincerity; I respect them very much” Mr. Dodds went on. “There is no constituency in the country which has had a cleaner fight than we have had.” 

</p>, <p>He thanked his supporters for the way they had assisted him to be head of the poll and hoped all the people in the constituency would quickly forget differences of opinion in regard to politics. They all had to live together and they could fight again for their principles. In the meantime, he hoped they would be good citizens.

</p>, <p>In conclusion, Mr. Dodds referred to his imminent visit to the House of Commons, with officials of the local branch of U.N.A., to hand in a question asking the Prime Minister to take early steps to call a conference with the object of finding ways and means to outlaw the hydrogen bomb and atomic weapons.

</p>, <p>Miss Roberts added her thanks to the Mayor and the Town Clerk and his staff for the way they had officiated at the election with the minimum amount of trouble and the maximum amount of efficiency.

</p>, <p>She wished Mr. Dodds as happy a time in the new Parliament as in the last, and to her own supporters she offered her grateful thanks.

</p>, <p>She had never known a group of people work harder. “You sign on for next time to-morrow morning,” she told them.

</p>, <p>Mr. Giles also supported and thanked his own small band of followers. He was badly handicapped in being a late starter, and he thought the Liberals had done “Jolly well.” 

</p>, <p>In keeping with the rest of the country, polling was very high, 85.67 per cent. voting out of an electorate of 79,089.

</p>, <p>Over 14,000 more votes were cast than in 1945. As the electorate has increased by only 4,622 that meant that over 9,000 persons who did not go to the poll last time voted this year. The increase was approximately 14 per cent.

</p>, <p>Mr. Dodds' majority fell by 6,077, but his poll increased by 1,462. Miss Roberts took 7,539 more votes than her predecessor, Major R. E. W. Grubb, in 1945, and lowered the gap between Labour and Conservative from 19,715 to 13,638, despite the intervention of Mr. Harry Giles, the Liberal.

</p>, <p>A presiding officer commented that the 7 a.m. opening of polling stations had been fully justified. There had been a “very brisk trade” all day long, and no slack periods.

</p>, <p>The Acting Returning Officer (Town Clerk Mr. T. Armstrong) who, with the Mayor, spent 10 hours touring the 100 polling stations in the constituency, told the <i>Kentish Times</i>: “I have experienced in some capacity or other elections since 1923, and from my angle this has been the quietest. I had no complaints from the polling stations about anything.” 

</p>, <p>Spoiled papers numbered 61. Some voters put their crosses against the name of a candidate, and then added remarks against the names of other candidates. This led to disqualification, as did the fact that some people dispensed with the legal cross and put their polling numbers in the space provided.

</p>, <p>Mr. Dodds, in an interview, told our reporter: “I was particularly impressed during the election by the fervour of many of my supporters, who showed a great deal of enthusiasm. I shall endeavour to be a Member who will look after the interests of all <span class="page">[end p1]</span> in the time open to me in this new government.

</p>, <p> “Not one of the political Parties is satisfied with the result, but in view of the very high poll, I cannot see that any good can come out of an election in the near future. There may be some decisive result when the new register comes into effect.

</p>, <p> “Sufficient of the people have clearly indicated that there must be a halt to further nationalisation and I think we will be very wise to accept that. From a personal point of view I am more than ready to accept it, because I recognise that the average man-in-the-street cannot as yet fully appreciate what nationalisation has meant to those basic industries already taken over. Until we can prove that nationalisation is a decided advantage we cannot expect the mass of the people to be enthusiastic.

</p>, <p> “I do claim that there is not a constituency in the country in which opponents fought a cleaner fight. Although we differ in politics, I recognise their sincerity. We have emerged from the hustings very good friends.

</p>, <p> “My final tribute is to my wife, who added to her grand work during the whole of the election period by making effective use of the platform at later meetings.” 

</p>, <p>Miss Roberts said: “I am back at work this week, but shall continue to live in Dartford. We are all very, very cheerful over the result, and our workers are very determined indeed to do even better next time.

</p>, <p> “It is really amazing the offers of active help offered in the past few days for the next election. People who had previously merely supported us with their votes are now flocking to join us and become active members. We are all very encouraged about it.

</p>, <p> “I shall certainly not be leaving Dartford—not by any means—and I hope I shall be the candidate at the next election. Compared with the results all over the country and with the other parts of Kent, we are very pleased with what we did and we are determined to reverse the result next time. Our workers were magnificent—I cannot thank them enough—and they have been absolutely magnificent about the result.

</p>, <p> “They are literally straining at the leash to get going again and have not given my agent, Mr. R. W. Mills, a moment's peace since Friday. I myself went away for the week-end before returning to work but found myself sitting down making plans for the future.

</p>, <p> “The election result leaves the Socialists in power, but they will reap the harvest of their own wild oats. They cannot be arrogant now without their steam roller majority. Had we had that small majority, they would have played it up and made a lot of trouble.” 

</p>, <p>Mr. Harry Giles said: “I made many friends in Dartford, where the spirit of the Liberals is akin to that I found among soldiers in the desert during the North African campaign.

</p>, <p> “Considering that two of the three weeks I spent in the Division were devoted to organisation and only one to electioneering, I must say that I think our poll was very high. In readiness for any future election the Liberal Association in Dartford will be built up. We shall re-form the association in a few weeks' time; already we have the names of many young Liberals eager to get on with the job.

</p>, <p> “This time the split-vote issue was the main reason for our downfall—it virtually killed us at the time. But the Liberals should not take their defeat badly. After all, there are still 2,750,000 people who want Liberalism according to the voting. Liberals should go on fighting for what they think is right. They must educate the youngsters—must teach them Liberalism.

</p>, <p> “If the Parties went to the country again in a few months, they would discover that people had not changed their minds in such a short time. I think the only thing Members can do is to try to work together, even if it is only for eighteen months or two years. They should sink their Party differences and try to get the country back on a good economic basis. They should think about the country and not about the Party.” </p>, <p>Copyright © Margaret Thatcher Foundation 2018. All Rights Reserved.

Phillips), and the hon. secretary (Mrs. T. Dalby). A letter containing a question addressed to the Prime Minister dealing with the outlawing of the hydrogen bomb was handed to the officer by the Mayor.

</p>, <p>At 2.30 the same morning Mr. Dodds had been declared elected with a majority of 13,638 votes.

</p>, <p>He immediately expressed the belief that he would have the support of all people in the borough, irrespective of politics or religion, in submitting for inclusion at the first question-time in the newly-elected House the following question:—

</p>, <p>"Mr. Dodds—to ask the Prime Minister if he is aware of the passionate desire of the people that he should take the initiative in endeavouring to call a conference with the object of finding ways and means of outlawing the hydrogen bomb and atomic weapons."

</p>, <p>After delivering the letter the delegation went to U.N.A. Headquarters at Maiden-lane, W.C., where they saw the secretary (Mr. C. J. Judd), who was delighted with the effort Dartford U.N.A. were making on a subject in which public opinion had to be roused.

</p>, <p>The Mayor will call a meeting of all Churches, organisations, business houses, etc., to discuss the possibility of holding a large meeting on the subject in the future.

</p>, <p>The count took place at Dartford Grammar School and a crowd of about 100 was eagerly waiting when the result was declared at 2.30 a.m. as follows:—

</p>, <p>Previously, inside the hall, the three candidates shook hands after a few introductory remarks from the Mayor of Dartford and Mr. Dodds said how pleased he was that it was the Mayor's lot to make such an important announcement.

</p>, <p>"I would like to say to Mr. Armstrong (Town Clerk of Dartford) and his staff that I am sure the other candidates will agree with me that the work has been carried out efficiently and with great courtesy," he added.

</p>, <p>Of the police, Mr. Dodds said that generally they were a great comfort to people inside the polling booths and he congratulated them on the able way they had carried out their duties.

</p>, <p>He thought both of his opponents had put up a marvellous show.

</p>, <p>"I think there is no difference in the amount of sincerity; I respect them very much" Mr. Dodds went on. "There is no constituency in the country which has had a cleaner fight than we have had."

</p>, <p>He thanked his supporters for the way they had assisted him to be head of the poll and hoped all the people in the constituency would quickly forget differences of opinion in regard to politics. They all had to live together and they could fight again for their principles. In the meantime, he hoped they would be good citizens.

</p>, <p>In conclusion, Mr. Dodds referred to his imminent visit to the House of Commons, with officials of the local branch of U.N.A., to hand in a question asking the Prime Minister to take early steps to call a conference with the object of finding ways and means to outlaw the hydrogen bomb and atomic weapons.

</p>, <p>Miss Roberts added her thanks to the Mayor and the Town Clerk and his staff for the way they had officiated at the election with the minimum amount of trouble and the maximum amount of efficiency.

</p>, <p>She wished Mr. Dodds as happy a time in the new Parliament as in the last, and to her own supporters she offered her grateful thanks.

</p>, <p>She had never known a group of people work harder. "You sign on for next time to-morrow morning," she told them.

</p>, <p>Mr. Giles also supported and thanked his own small band of followers. He was badly handicapped in being a late starter, and he thought the Liberals had done "Jolly well."

</p>, <p>In keeping with the rest of the country, polling was very high, 85.67 per cent. voting out of an electorate of 79,089.

</p>, <p>Over 14,000 more votes were cast than in 1945. As the electorate has increased by only 4,622 that meant that over 9,000 persons who did not go to the poll last time voted this year. The increase was approximately 14 per cent.

</p>, <p>Mr. Dodds' majority fell by 6,077, but his poll increased by 1,462. Miss Roberts took 7,539 more votes than her predecessor, Major R. E. W. Grubb, in 1945, and lowered the gap between Labour and Conservative from 19,715 to 13,638, despite the intervention of Mr. Harry Giles, the Liberal.

</p>, <p>A presiding officer commented that the 7 a.m. opening of polling stations had been fully justified. There had been a "very brisk trade" all day long, and no slack periods.

</p>, <p>The Acting Returning Officer (Town Clerk Mr. T. Armstrong) who, with the Mayor, spent 10 hours touring the 100 polling stations in the constituency, told the <i>Kentish Times</i>: "I have experienced in some capacity or other elections since 1923, and from my angle this has been the quietest. I had no complaints from the polling stations about anything."

</p>, <p>Spoiled papers numbered 61. Some voters put their crosses against the name of a candidate, and then added remarks against the names of other candidates. This led to disqualification, as did the fact that some people dispensed with the legal cross and put their polling numbers in the space provided.

</p>, <p>Mr. Dodds, in an interview, told our reporter: "I was particularly impressed during the election by the fervour of many of my supporters, who showed a great deal of enthusiasm. I shall endeavour to be a Member who will look after the interests of all <span class="page">[end p1]</span> in the time open to me in this new government.

</p>, <p>"Not one of the political Parties is satisfied with the result, but in view of the very high poll, I cannot see that any good can come out of an election in the near future. There may be some decisive result when the new register comes into effect.

</p>, <p>"Sufficient of the people have clearly indicated that there must be a halt to further nationalisation and I think we will be very wise to accept that. From a personal point of view I am more than ready to accept it, because I recognise that the average man-in-the-street cannot as yet fully appreciate what nationalisation has meant to those basic industries already taken over. Until we can prove that nationalisation is a decided advantage we cannot expect the mass of the people to be enthusiastic.

</p>, <p>"I do claim that there is not a constituency in the country in which opponents fought a cleaner fight. Although we differ in politics, I recognise their sincerity. We have emerged from the hustings very good friends.

</p>, <p>"My final tribute is to my wife, who added to her grand work during the whole of the election period by making effective use of the platform at later meetings."

</p>, <p>Miss Roberts said: "I am back at work this week, but shall continue to live in Dartford. We are all very, very cheerful over the result, and our workers are very determined indeed to do even better next time.

</p>, <p>"It is really amazing the offers of active help offered in the past few days for the next election. People who had previously merely supported us with their votes are now flocking to join us and become active members. We are all very encouraged about it.

</p>, <p>"I shall certainly not be leaving Dartford—not by any means—and I hope I shall be the candidate at the next election. Compared with the results all over the country and with the other parts of Kent, we are very pleased with what we did and we are determined to reverse the result next time. Our workers were magnificent—I cannot thank them enough—and they have been absolutely magnificent about the result.

</p>, <p>"They are literally straining at the leash to get going again and have not given my agent, Mr. R. W. Mills, a moment's peace since Friday. I myself went away for the week-end before returning to work but found myself sitting down making plans for the future.

</p>, <p>"The election result leaves the Socialists in power, but they will reap the harvest of their own wild oats. They cannot be arrogant now without their steam roller majority. Had we had that small majority, they would have played it up and made a lot of trouble."

</p>, <p>Mr. Harry Giles said: "I made many friends in Dartford, where the spirit of the Liberals is akin to that I found among soldiers in the desert during the North African campaign.

</p>, <p>"Considering that two of the three weeks I spent in the Division were devoted to organisation and only one to electioneering, I must say that I think our poll was very high. In readiness for any future election the Liberal Association in Dartford will be built up. We shall re-form the association in a few weeks' time; already we have the names of many young Liberals eager to get on with the job.

</p>, <p>"This time the split-vote issue was the main reason for our downfall—it virtually killed us at the time. But the Liberals should not take their defeat badly. After all, there are still 2,750,000 people who want Liberalism according to the voting. Liberals should go on fighting for what they think is right. They must educate the youngsters—must teach them Liberalism.

</p>, <p>"If the Parties went to the country again in a few months, they would discover that people had not changed their minds in such a short time. I think the only thing Members can do is to try to work together, even if it is only for eighteen months or two years. They should sink their Party differences and try to get the country back on a good economic basis. They should think about the country and not about the Party."</p>, <p>Copyright © Margaret Thatcher Foundation 2018. All Rights Reserved.

</p>, <p>The dance was held to mark the anniversary of the adoption of Miss Roberts as Conservative candidate in the Division, and had been postponed because of the General Election.

</p>, <p>On behalf of the association, Mr. J. L. M. Miller (chairman), presented Miss Roberts with a parchment scroll containing the names of active helpers and subscribers in her recent campaign.

</p>, <p> “I think you will all agree with me,” said Mr. Miller, amid applause, “that the vote she polled was a triumph for her.” 

</p>, <p>Presenting the scroll as a “token of gratitude” from the Division, Mr. Miller said that at the moment it was almost 16ft. long and contained 991 names. Further names were still to be added, and it was hoped it would soon be 20ft. long, with 1,000 names.

</p>, <p>Returning thanks, Miss Roberts said she would cherish the scroll all her life. They could have given her nothing more touching and she would like to thank them all for the tremendous work they had done throughout her campaign. Without their help they should never have done so well as they did, and she thought they had done as well as any other Division in Kent. She particularly thanked Mr. Miller and her agent, Mr. R. W. Mills, who had, she said, “worked nearly 24 hours a day for her.” 

</p>, <p>But, added Miss Roberts, it was necessary for everyone whose name appeared on the scroll to continue to work for the organisation, and for each to bring another into the fold.

</p>, <p>If they did, she knew they would have a very grand ball after the next election—a Victory Ball.

</p>, <p>Miss Roberts concluded by saying that Dartford had done a very great deal for her personally since she had been in the Division. Loyalty had been one of the greatest factors. The Division would keep her as long as they wished to have her.

</p>, <p>On behalf of Highfield Ward, Miss Roberts was presented with a bouquet by Miss Mary Rohan.

</p>, <p>Another presentation by Mr. Miller was an anniversay cake—the gift of Mr. R. F. Fyson—which was later auctioneed by the slice by Miss Roberts in aid of the election fighting fund.

</p>, <p>Miss Roberts was also presented with an evening bag, “With deepest affection and great love from the Young Conservatives,” by Mr. L. Gordon Waterman.

</p>, <p>Music for dancing was provided by the Bob Miller Orchestra, with Mr. L. F. Lowther (Erith) as M.C.</p>, <p>Copyright © Margaret Thatcher Foundation 2018. All Rights Reserved.

She was adopted at a meeting of the Divisional Conservative Asociation on Tuesday evening, and spoke of “operation doorstep” —a mass-canvass plan to swing the vote.

</p>, <p>Miss Roberts was presented with a marcasite brooch in recognition of her work in the last campaign.

</p>, <p>Mr. A. Morris Wheeler (president of the association) was in the chair and with him on the platform were Mr. J. L. M. Miller (chairman), Mrs. D. M. Fletcher (chairman of the Divisional Women's Advisory Council), Mr. J. F. L. Gates (chairman of Erith Borough Conservative Group), Miss Mary Hamilton (chairman of Divisional Young Conservatives), Mr. J. W. Panton and Mr. R. W. Mills (agent).

</p>, <p>Formal adoption of Miss Roberts as prospective candidate was moved by Mr. Gates, who said they would not have got such a good result last time unless they had had such an excellent candidate. In eulogising Miss Roberts' conduct of the election, he declared that she had treated her opponents and answered their questions in such a way that “even the ranks of Tuscany could scarce forbear to cheer.” 

</p>, <p>The next election was not far away, he added, and if they made a good fight last time, they could make a better one.

</p>, <p>Miss Mary Hamilton seconded, and the adoption was unanimously approved.

</p>, <p>Expressing her thanks, Miss Roberts said when she heard the results of the election, there was no doubt in her mind as to what she should do. Many people had told her that they expected her to find a safe, or safer, seat.

</p>, <p> “I never had any doubts at all,” she went on, “that if you wanted me to stay, I would stay and fight Dartford because I believe it can be won.” 

</p>, <p>Commenting on the tremendous enthusiasm and loyalty shown since she had been in the Division, Miss Roberts declared that the spirit of the association was second to none.

</p>, <p> “The association has made tremendous strides” she continued. “We have increased our membership by over 50 per cent. in 12 months, and we will take careful note of the hint about the Erith area and see it is rectified. By their principle of deeds, and not words, the Young Conservatives have set us a wonderful example, and that must be our guiding influence in future.” 

</p>, <p>Miss Roberts emphasised that the next election, which was to come sooner than anticipated, was just a continuation of the last. Their job now was to convert the “doubtfuls.” 

</p>, <p> “That means we have got to get out to them,” she said. “The keynote of the inter-period before the next election must be ‘Operation Door-step,’ and we must get down to it without delay.” 

</p>, <p>Expressing special thanks to their chairman (Mr. John Miller) and Mrs. Miller for all they had done, Miss Roberts said they must all stride forward in their efforts. They must fight on if they were to achieve the necessary 6,000 or 7,000 vote “swing” which they must have next time.</p>, <p>Copyright © Margaret Thatcher Foundation 2018. All Rights Reserved.

</p>, <p>This decision was announced by the chairman (Mr. J. L. M. Miller) at a meeting at St. Alban's-road Schools, Dartford, on Tuesday, at which a new St. Alban's Ward branch of the association was formed.

</p>, <p>The subject of the local elections arose at the end of the meeting when the newly-elected branch chairman (Mr. G. C. Pottle) was asked if they had any candidate in mind for the ward. The questioner said he understood that St. Alban's branch of the Ratepayers Association had again unanimously nominated Mr. A. F. Taylor to the executive. Mr. Taylor was an anti-Socialist, he added.

</p>, <p>Mr. Miller said he had recommended to his association—and they had accepted it—that they should not put Conservative candidates into the field for the 1950 municipal elections. With regard to the question of support for Mr. Taylor, he would like to make it clear that that was in Mr. Taylor 's hands. If Mr. Taylor wanted their support, they would give it him.

</p>, <p> “It is not our wish in any way to embarrass any candidate,” added Mr. Miller. “We shall support any anti-Socialist candidate who is prepared to accept our support.” 

</p>, <p>Miss Margaret Roberts, Conservative candidate, pointed out that if they formed the proposed new branch that evening they would have, theoretically, 100 per cent. “cover” in the Division.

</p>, <p>If the Opposition could defeat the Government as they did last week, she said, they might have an election at any time. It was obvious this could not go on very long. Their work now would be to get out and convert the “doubtfuls.” Their key-note must be canvassing.

</p>, <p>Mr. L. Gordon Waterman was in the chair, and the motion to form the new St. Alban's branch was unanimously carried, on the motion of Mr. G. C. Pottle, seconded by Mr. Jack Saunders, to both of whom tribute was paid by Mr. R. W. Mills (agent).

</p>, <p>The following officers were elected: Chairman, Mr. G. C. Pottle; vice-chairman, Mr. Jack Saunders; hon. treasurer, Miss Dorothy Saunders; hon. secretary, Miss Pamela Denne (Brentfield, Brentfield-road); committee, Miss E. Gray, Mrs. H. J. Shand, Miss M. Pottle, Miss Audrey Garner Mrs. Essex, and Messrs. A. Richardson and Arthur Johnstone.

</p>, <p>Dartford Ratepayers Association will contest all vacancies. Prospective candidates are: Brent Ward, Mr. S. W. Harle; St. Alban's, Mr. A. F. Taylor; Town, Mr. Tommy Atkins; Priory, Mr. H. W. Jones; Highfield, Mr. P. J. Townshend; Heath, Mr. E. C. G. Lanyon.</p>, <p>Copyright © Margaret Thatcher Foundation 2018. All Rights Reserved.

</p>, <p>The meeting was called by the Mayor of Dartford (Councillor Mrs. Flora Welch), who presided, for representatives to discuss what could be done to urge the Government to make constant endeavours to end the “atomic deadlock.” 

</p>, <p>The Mayor said Dartford should give a lead and let the Government know that the people wanted to secure peace on earth and goodwill to all men. That night's meeting was in the nature of a foundation for another and larger meeting to be held on May 19 at Dartford Grammar School.

</p>, <p>Mr. Dodds described the meeting as a “sort of working party,” in which there was joint consultation between various organisations and civic heads of the district. “We in Dartford might be the means of inspiring people not only in this country, but all over the world,” he said.

</p>, <p> “It is no good people in Dartford saying, Why don't they do something in Manchester or Edinburgh?' There must be leaders. Why not from Dartford?” 

</p>, <p>Governments had not much confidence in other governments, and the strongest thing that would bind peoples of different countries together would be a combined effort of the ordinary people for peace.

</p>, <p>He himself had certain ideas he wished to put forward on how organisations, business houses, Churches, schools, youth and sports clubs could help. Organisations could work for membership, there could be teams of canvassers, and they could make arrangements for social events. There could be a U.N.A. show at Dartford Gala, and the association's work publicised. Perhaps the profit from a future Mayoral Ball could be devoted to Dartford U.N.A.

</p>, <p>Business houses could buy space in the newspapers ( “This space given by courtesy of …   .” ) for the purposes of U.N.A. Traders in the town should be prepared to display U.N.A. notices. In the churches references could be made to the association's work. He would like to see the Churches combine one Sunday, with U.N.A. as their theme. A similar combination could take place with the purpose of canvassing between such organisations as the Labour League of Youth and the Young Conservatives. No politics would, of course enter into the matter. Sports clubs could, perhaps, hold a tournament on behalf of U.N.A.

</p>, <p>The Member for Dartford drew attention to a petition which he hoped people would sign. The petition was headed, “We, the undersigned, earnestly desiring the restoration of peace and friendship throughout the world, petition His Majesty's Government to take immediate action, by all means in their power, which will lead to the outlawing of weapons of mass destruction.” 

</p>, <p>Speaking from the body of the hall, Miss Margaret Roberts, prospective Conservative candidate for Dartford, endorsed Mr. Dodds ' suggestion about canvassing by the political youth organisations. It might be a good idea to adopt one town in Russia, one in America and, say, one in France. The Young Conservatives had thought of presenting a pageant. They would willingly hand over their idea to the United Nations Association.

</p>, <p>Mr. W. Metson (U.N.A. head-quarters) hoped the various representatives would go back to their organisations and urge them to assist. “This is a people's movement, and I hope you are going to inspire your members to come along on May 19.” </p>, <p>Copyright © Margaret Thatcher Foundation 2018.

Roberts, B.A., B.Sc., prospective Conservative candidate, at the dinner of Belvedere North Conservative Club on Saturday.

</p>, <p>It was necessary for them to be ever watchful and take their lead from “the greatest living exponent of the cause for which they stood—Mr. Winston Churchill,” she continued, and advised them to be ready for another election.

</p>, <p>In the absence of Colonel the Hon. Angus MacDonnell, C.M.G., C.B. (president), who is taking Queen Mary's carpet through the United States and Canada, the chair was taken by Mr. J. Cash.

</p>, <p>The dinner was held at the Masonic Hall, Belvedere, and among the visitors was Mr. H. Wyatt, on holiday from South Africa, who spoke of politics in the Union being far more bitter than anything ever known in England.

</p>, <p>Mr. A. Hawes (treasurer) having briefly praised the club as being “a very good crowd,” Mr. A. D. Ward (auditor) said he could perhaps, take a more detached view than a committees man. He could vouch for the soundness of their finances and that evening's function was evidence of the club's success.

</p>, <p>Remarking that she was the only woman present, Miss Roberts doubted whether at that stage of her career any shyness was left. especially in such congenial company. They might well lend a few of their committee men to <span class="nm">Sir Stafford Cripps</span>the Chancellor of the Exchequer (Laughter.)

</p>, <p>When she went into the last campaign it was with the help of them all and she would soon be calling on them again. The next election would be most important and she hoped it would be as cleanly fought as was the last one.

</p>, <p>Having spoken of the need to be watchful and ready for the fight when it came, Miss Roberts said that above all else Mr. Churchill was a grand fighter— “one man who will never be too old to fight.” 

</p>, <p>The reply came from Mr. H. Winn, prospective Conservative candidate for Abbey Wood Ward in the forthcoming municipal election. He thanked Miss Roberts for her challenging call, but remarked that whereas she had got rid of her “L” plates, his were well and truly fixed.

</p>, <p>Mr. J. Culley said their visitors that evening were helpers and leaders rather than mere guests, and Miss Roberts was certainly a fully-fledged driver now.

</p>, <p>Mr. D. Cornfoot congratulated Miss Roberts on her excellent fight and looked for her success next time.

</p>, <p>Mr. F. Bryant submitted “The Press,” to which Mr. C. Fred House, F.J.I. (Editor, <i>Erith Observer</i>) responded.

</p>, <p>Mr. F. O. Howell paid tribute to the chairman, who had piloted them through a tiresome, troublesome, but most notable year with success.

</p>, <p>Mr. A. Hawes was presented with the A.C.C. Distinguished Medal, for five years' conspicuous service by Miss Roberts, who remarked that his service extended over a far longer period.

</p>, <p></p>, <p> “Our finances were thought to be far worse than we knew. Do not be misled by small things, such as a few eggs off the ration. We are still not paying our way, and until we do we shall never be a prosperous country,” MT said.

</p>, <p>MT asserted her strong patriotism. People seemed these days to be “pro anything,” rather than pro-British. “I believe love of one's country is a virtue so long as the country stands, as this country stands, for freedom and democracy,” MT said.

</p>, <p>MT thought children might be taught more loyalty to their country.

</p>, <p>The meeting, convened by Dartford United Nations Association, had as its subject “The hydrogen bomb and atomic weapons.” The chief speakers were Lord Strabolgi, Labour Peer, and Miss K. D. Courtney.

</p>, <p>Mr. Dodds said it was hoped that the efforts of members of Dartford U.N.A. would make some contribution to the education of people in the vital problem of taking an intelligent interest in the task of endeavouring to keep peace in the world. He had already heard of an incident in connection with the U.N.A. petition which emphasised the gravity of that task.

</p>, <p>A petition form had been handed in to a department at Vickers-Armstrongs in Dartford. When a member went to collect the form there were no names on it.

</p>, <p> “An astonishing explanation was given,” said Mr. Dodds. “It was to the effect that as their employment depended largely on producing weapons of war they could not support any moves which would injure their chances of employment.

</p>, <p> “This is almost criminal foolishness. Do they not realise that it is because we spend so much in this way that we cannot get all the houses, schools, hospitals and such like that we need?” 

</p>, <p> “Do they not realise that if our need for weapons of war was less they would still be employed—making the things people want? Fortunately this state of affairs is not typical, at Vickers-Armstrongs. I am happy to say that another department has given in four pages of signatures.” 

</p>, <p>The president (Canon Elliott Mitchell), put forward what he called “two sombre and sinister facts.” The world to-day was very deeply divided—by belief, way of life, purpose, policy, and intention. Mankind was menaced by the possibility of physical destruction. In past wars, which had brought in their train calamity, sorrow and suffering, there had been hope for the future—one could always say “After the war, we will do this, or do that.” But with the emergence of the hydrogen bomb a message became clear; it was “Abandon hope, all you who use me.” Mankind, by means of its greatest triumph in science, would produce this bomb for the total destruction of the human race and to make this planet uninhabitable, anyway. It was up to all members of the Church to teach peace, love and brotherhood.

</p>, <p>Miss K. D. Courtney, C.B.E., joint-president of U.N.A. in this country, said that the Americans, at one time the only people to have the bomb, had produced a plan for its control. The Soviet had a different plan. Could there be no compromise?

</p>, <p>On behalf of the National Executive, Miss Courtney referred to “the splendid job that Dartford has done with regard to this question.” 

</p>, <p>Lady Strabolgi, who accompanied her husband, in a short speech drew attention to the fact that the League of Nations had failed because it was not supported by the governments. To-day they lived in an atmosphere of cold war. This seemed ridiculous, when all people desired peace. U.N.A. had to be supported.

</p>, <p>Mr. Norman Dodds, appealing for members, spoke warmly of the Young Conservatives and the Labour League of Youth, who together were stewarding the meeting.

</p>, <p>Lord Strabolgi spoke after the interval (during which a collection raised £16 10s.) He said he was not completely pessimistic about the situation to-day; there was (he thought) a better atmosphere in recent weeks.

</p>, <p>He paid a tribute to M. Trygve Lie, who had been in Moscow with high hopes of finding a solution. He was trying to act as a catalyst between East and West. The leaders of both groups did not wish war and in that wish they were certainly echoing the opinions of their peoples. The speaker could not believe that a deliberate act of aggression would come from Russia for many years—at least until a great measure of reconstruction had been achieved; but with a war of nerves accidents could happen.

</p>, <p>He had received encouraging reports from China, where the British were held in high esteem. There might be another approach to Moscow through China.

</p>, <p>It was the job of the ordinary person to help to create a public opinion which would prevail in the end.

</p>, <p>Miss Margaret Roberts, prospective Conservative candidate for Dartford, said the question had to be faced realistically. She mentioned the reports from China, for instance. All had to be considered—and a ship called the Amethyst had also to be remembered.

</p>, <p>The first aim with regard to the weapons was the maintenance of peace in the world. There had to be better relations, and one had to work for improvements all the time. If one were to approach a state of security the cold war had to take a turn for considerably warmer conditions. There was absolutely no chance of unilateral disarmament, there had to be disarmament on the part of the whole world. Among the ordinary people there was no desire for war.

</p>, <p>Mr. R. L. Hudson, proposing a vote of thanks to the speakers, said he was proud to work for U.N.A. when he looked up over the stage and saw the school crest—a memorial to 60 old boys who did not come back. <span class="page">[end p1]</span>
</p>, <p></p>, <p class="nonmt">Speaking of the lead Dartford has given to the remainder of the country in the effort to outlaw the atomic and hydrogen bombs, Lady Strabolgi, at a public meeting at the Grammar School on Friday, said: “Perhaps what Dartford does to-day the rest of Britain will do to-morrow.” 

</p>, <p>Evidence that the Borough's activities in this direction had already attracted overseas notice was proved in a message which the Mayor, Councillor Mrs. Flora Welch, J.P., had received from a lady in New Zealand. It read: “Good luck, Dartford; we are proud of you in New Zealand.” 

</p>, <p>The president of the Dartford Branch of the United Nations Association, Rev. Canon Elliott Mitchell, said: “The world to-day is deeply divided, more deeply divided than in all its tragic history.” 

</p>, <p>The H-bomb, he thought, held this message for mankind: “Abandon hope all you who use me.” Where the atom bomb had killed thousands, this new menace would obliterate millions and threatened the destruction of the whole human race.

</p>, <p> “That,” said Cannon Mitchell, “Is what modern man has come to. It is up to the Church to help U.N.O. face the facts.” 

</p>, <p>Peace, love and brotherhood, he considered, should constitute the main theme for teaching in both churches and schools.

</p>, <p>Miss K. D. Courtney, C.B.E., who has worked most of her life for the cause of peace, said the efforts to ban the bombs could only be successful if there was a rigid system of control.

</p>, <p> “It is certainly not a friendly little object.” she commented.

</p>, <p>She outlined the approach of both east and west to the problem. Only America appeared to have the A-bomb, and Russia advocated therefore that the weapon should be destroyed. The West, however, believed international ownership, management and inspection to be the answer to the question. A compromise, she thought, would give some security, although she personally was a great believer in inspection.

</p>, <p>Lord Strabolgi said that the situation did not leave him entirely pessimistic. Mr. Trygve Lie was in Moscow at that very moment and was not without hope of finding a solution. He was trying to act as a catalyst between East and West.

</p>, <p>Within the previous 48 hours, Lord Strabolgi said, he had received news from missionaries and businessmen in China. They informed him that they were better treated under the new Communist Government than they had been under the National regime.

</p>, <p> “I think,” he said, “there may be some means of approach to Moscow through Pekin because of the high esteem in which Britons are held in China.” 

</p>, <p>Lord Strabolgi said he could not believe that any deliberate act of aggression could come from Russia or China because of the tremendous amount of reconstruction work they had still to do as a result of the last war.

</p>, <p> “International public opinion can prevail,” he declared, “and our job is to create that public opinion. If done sufficiently it will effect governments and good sense and good-heartedness among people will result.” 

</p>, <p>In a typically forceful speech, Mr. Norman Dodds, M.P., appealed for members for the United Nations' Association.

</p>, <p> “It is hoped,” he said, “that by the efforts of members of the Dartford Branch of the Association some con <i>[line missing]</i> their responsibilities in the vital task of endeavouring to keep the peace.” 

</p>, <p>Although other departments of Vickers-Armstrong's had responded well, a petition list had been returned from one shop, according to Mr. Dodds, without any signatures having been appended. When asked for the reason the collector was informed that as the people in the department earned their living making weapons of war they could not support any moves which might injure their chances of employment.

</p>, <p> “These foolish people, and I consider it a criminal form of foolishness,” said Mr. Dodds, “do not seem to realise that it is because we spend so much of the national income in this way that we cannot get all the houses, schools and hospitals we want. Do they not also realise that if our need for weapons of war was less, they would still be employed making things the nation needed?” 

</p>, <p>Miss Margaret Roberts said that although there might be, as Lord Strabolgi had stated, a way of approach to Moscow through Pekin, we must not forget a ship called the “Amethyst” nor fail to approach the question of the atom bomb realistically.

</p>, <p> “We will never have peace,” she maintained, “by putting on blinkers.” </p>, <p>Copyright © Margaret Thatcher Foundation 2018. All Rights Reserved.

</p>, <p>This was announced at the annual meeting of Orpington Divisional Association at the Village Hall, Orpington, on Friday and present to say “thank you” to their new “spiritual godparents” were Miss Margaret Roberts, (prospective candidate chairman) and Mr. John Miller (divisional chairman) of the Dartford Association.

</p>, <p>The scheme was announced by Major P. W. H. Twyman, K.C.C., divisional chairman, who presided in the absence through illness of the president, Mr. J. E. Brittenden. “Orpington has been coupled with Dartford,” he said, “and it is there that organised help will go, and a call for volunteers will be made and will be trained for their duties at Dartford. He added, “I ask you most earnestly to respond to this call.” 

</p>, <p>Miss Roberts spoke of the inspiration and encouragement the aid would be to Dartford. “Some people say Dartford is tough and that I have a difficult job,” she said. “The Division, with two short exceptions, had a Conservative Members up to 1938, so it is far from an impossible task. There is tremendous enthusiasm, and last time we put up our vote by 50 per cent. on 1945; if between now and the next election we put it up another 50 per cent. we shall be home. … Your help and encouragement will help us to achieve this and see the return of a Conservative Member to support a Conservative government.” 

</p>, <p>In his report, Major Twyman said membership had increased by 1,000 to almost 9,000 and two senior, two Young Conservative and one women's section branches had been formed. They had good reason to be proud of the present standard of organisation and he expressed thanks to all concerned, particularly the agent (Mr. Charles Knight). He also thanked the assistant agent (Mrs. M. Middleton) and Miss M. Young, of headquarters staff, for their work, the divisional officers and committee members, branch officials and committees.

</p>, <p>With the treasurer's statement, submitted by the Hon. W. Speke Philipps, the chairman's report was adopted, and it was decided to send a message of good wishes to the president, Mr. Brittenden, who was unanimously re-elected.

</p>, <p>By two votes, after a re-count, Mr. W. H. Rose, hon. secretary of Orpington Knoll and Goddington Ward association, was erected Divisional chairman, and Mr. F. Tanner (Horton Kirby) was elected vice-chairman. In Mr. Rose 's absence, Mr. Tannet presided for the rest of the meeting.

</p>, <p>Other elections were: Women's and Young Conservative vice-chairmen, Mrs. G. E. <i>[name illegible]</i> (Hodsell Street) and Mr. M. Stevens; hon. treasurer, Mr. Philipps.

</p>, <p>A vote of thanks to retiring officials coupled with a welcome to new officials was proposed by Mr. Allan Neal (West Kingsdown) and congratulations to the Division on their progress was expressed by Miss M. Cook, S.E. Area Agent.

</p>, <p>After enlarging on the work of Mr. Brittenden and thanking the members for their work at the election, Sir Waldron Smithers commented. “I have always been a bit of a rebel in the Party. I have tried to prevent them making promises which we could not guarantee and fulfill, and I have been recently semi-officially informed that my criticism has now been taken into consideration by the men at the top and has had a great effect on the policy of our Party. We refused to make detailed promises, but said we would deal with the sorry results of Socialist mis-government by Conservative and Christian principles, and we doubled our majority. I am sure that is the way to tackle it,” he added.

</p>, <p> “If each of us would respond to a kind of John the Baptist call and declare ourselves and come out on the side of Christianity against Communism! Things are happening in the world to-day—the Winnipeg floods, the tornado the other week, air crashes and the like—which show that there is a Power above that of man, and we must ask God's help in these difficult times. We can only solve our problems with His aid.” 

</p>, <p>Saying he was supported from many sides, even though he was supposed to have a “bee in his bonnet,” Sir Waldron urged the necessity of putting spiritual things first and then material things would follow. They must restore the basic things—prestige, confidence and credit. … Then, and then only, can you improve the condition of the people. “‘Seek ye first the Kingdom of God and all things will be added to you,’ we are hold. That is the truth and it has got to be done.” </p>, <p>Copyright © Margaret Thatcher Foundation 2018. All Rights Reserved.

(prospective Conservative candidate) will now have a say in the shaping of Conservative policy, as she has been appointed to the Party's national executive.

</p>, <p>First news of the appointment was given by Miss Roberts at Belvedere Conservative Club on Tuesday, when she addressed a meeting to combine Belvedere women's section and the recently-formed men's branch into one ward organisation in readiness for the next General Election.

</p>, <p>The candidate told members that personalities alone did not win elections—that could not even be said of Mr. Churchill. Much depended on efficient ward organisations and the work between elections.

</p>, <p>Success in Bexley and Chislehurst depended to a certain extent on the strength of Conservatism in the Dartford constituency; if they did not put up a concentrated opposition the Socialists would be able to spare support for the marginal districts.

</p>, <p>Commenting on the Schuman Plan, Miss Roberts said international understanding could not be founded on suspicion, but what else would the Labour policy statement breed, for a Labour Party said one thing and a Labour Government another.

</p>, <p>One could not underestimate the seriousness of the situation, and it could well facilitate an election. That meant the Divisional Party would need money, for it cost £3,000 to carry on the Divisional organisation and an additional £900 for an election.

</p>, <p>Miss Roberts emphasised: “At the moment the Socialists are slowing up on their left-wing schemes, but if they are returned for another five years they will bring them back with force.” 

</p>, <p>Mr. D. H. J. Cummingham, elected chairman of the new combined branch, likened the political situation to a card game— “We have lost some of our diamonds, but our hearts are still good, and if necessary we can go in with our clubs.</p>, <p>Copyright © Margaret Thatcher Foundation 2018.

M.A., B.Sc., prospective Conservative candidate, when she spoke at a meeting of St. Alban's Ward branch of Dartford Division Conservative Association on Monday.

</p>, <p>After outlining the events leading up to the conflict in Korea, Miss Roberts said that in the occupation the Russians had made sure that in North Korea they left behind an army equipped with Communist ideology and the inclination to fight. The Americans withdrew from the South after making some attempt to make them rule by democratic methods.

</p>, <p>North Korea was left ready and equipped with an army to march into South Korea. It would take some time for those taken unawates in the South to put up sufficient resistance, even with American help.

</p>, <p> “The situation in Korea at the moment is very, very serious indeed,” added Miss Roberts. “There is the threat that we might be thrown off the Korean peninsula before we have sufficient troops and materials to withstand the blow.” 

</p>, <p>Miss Roberts said they had been aware of the Communist menace, but if they were aware of it they should have been equipped to fight it. It might break out in other places. To put in troops there we might take them away from places where the Communists were as organised as they were in North Korea.

</p>, <p>Mr. Churchill had rightly asked that our defences all over the world should be reviewed. At the moment it was speed in which we were lacking. They were hoping the Government would make use of the necessary experience and resource of Mr. Churchill.

</p>, <p>The Korean situation, she went on, had put Party problems out of their minds. Nevertheless, they might still have to face a General Election. The housing situation was as serious as before the last election, and labour problems had been accentuated by the wage “freeze.” They might have to fight a General Election this year.

</p>, <p>She thought the progress of St. Alban's Ward branch (formed in April) had been first-class, and she was certain in the next election it would be one of the best wards in the Division. The branch owed a great deal to its officers.

</p>, <p>Urging vigorous canvassing, Miss Roberts said the most important people to deal with were the “doubtfuls.” and if they knew who they were, they would have far more chance of winning their vote.

</p>, <p>Miss Roberts was thanked by the chairman (Mr. George Pottle).

</p>, <p>The reports of the hon. secretary (Miss Pamela Denne) and the hon. treasurer (Miss Dorothy Saunders) were adopted.

</p>, <p>When the meeting agreed to vote £15 to the centre fund of the local association, Miss Roberts remarked, “I think for a new ward it is absolutely thrilling.”

</p>, <p>The fete was organised to help raise sufficient funds for the next general election campaign.

W. Panton and Mr. Gordon Waterman, faced a barrage of questions from Mr. G. W. Phillips (question master) at Belvedere Young Conservative Association's political brains trust, held at the Conservative Club, Pieardy-road, on Monday.

</p>, <p>Asked whether, in view of the need for increased production, he thought a six-day working week was necessary, Mr. Panton said he did not like compulsion. If a man could earn sufficient for his needs in five days, it was obvious he would not work more.

</p>, <p>The solution he thought, was to create a state of affairs in which workers had to work a 50-hour week in order to earn enough to satisfy their requirements. Miners before the war produced coal as they did because they had to work a certain number of hours to earn the money they needed.

</p>, <p> “That is a dangerous thing to say, Mr. Panton,” said Miss Roberts, who thought his system would tend to increase absenteeism. Rather it would be better to give men an incentive to work harder durin; five days. Otherwise the good worker suffered in the same way as the bad worker.

</p>, <p>What makes a successful politician? was another question, and Mr. Waterman thought the best qualifications were sincerity and sympathy, and an ability to listen to the other fellow's point of view.

</p>, <p>Miss Roberts agreed but said to be a good mixer was just as important for a constituency politician—” to mix with kings nor lose the common touch.” 

</p>, <p>Mr. Panton suggested that qualifications depended on what party one was representing.

</p>, <p>How would Conservatives deal with Communist-inspired industrial unrest?

</p>, <p>Mr. Panton said, “The general strike was over in a week, and no doubt we could deal with a similar situation. The working-man is not a bad chap, but he is easily led astray.” 

</p>, <p>Mr. Waterman thought the purpose of trades unions should be re-defined, and Miss Roberts was of opinion that general strikes should be made illegal.

</p>, <p>The gathering saw the birth of a new branch, Erith East Conservative Mixed branch, to fill a gap in the election organisation.

</p>, <p>Miss Roberts said she was glad to see new faces at the meeting. At the moment, people were very politically conscious after two Party political broadcasts. There would most likely be a General Election in the autumn, so that meeting was of an urgent nature.

</p>, <p>Commenting on the <span class="nm">Clement Attlee</span>Prime Minister's reply to Mr. Churchill, Miss Roberts said it might be true that the Conservative leader was not present at every debate. When Mr. Churchill made a speech it resounded the whole world over. That was the standard to judge by.

</p>, <p>The first world war was on such a gigantic scale that it was impossible to learn all the lessons from it, but during the last war the Coalition Government made preparations to meet the peace.

</p>, <p>It was arranged to put up pre-frabicated houses to fill the gap, sites to put them on were chosen and builders were released from the Services.

</p>, <p>To-day, however, housing was one of the greatest domestic problems, and every week she (Miss Roberts) heard stories of suffering.

</p>, <p>It had been claimed there was a shortage of timber, but there was no world shortage, and it was rumoured that timber was wasting in the Scandinavian docks. Canada had offered to supply timber in exchange for machinery, yet the Government chose to trade with the Soviet Union.

</p>, <p>Miss Roberts said the duty' of the Opposition was to criticise, but when they did so <span class="nm">Clement Attlee</span>the Prime Minister launched an attack on <span class="nm">Winston Churchill</span>the man who led Britain during the war. They had been entitled to think Britain's armed forces were in an efficient condition—and then they learned Britain could field only a few divisions, the Air Force was only a fraction of the Soviet's, and the Navy far from what it should be. That, after £760,000,000 had been spent on defence.

</p>, <p>Conservatives wanted peace, but when friendship was met with a slap in the face, the only solution was to be equally strong.

</p>, <p> “We do not want to return a Conservative Government merely to oust the Socialists, but because we believe that is best for the country. It is not sufficient just to vote with us to achieve that end, but to work with us whole-heartedly,” concluded Miss Roberts.

</p>, <p> “If we do not vote Conservative this time we may not have the chance to do so again. We shall have to do what we are told, and people of my age will be bumped off,” claimed Mrs. G. W. H. Eletcher, who presided.

</p>, <p>There had never been a time when it had been more necessary for Conservatives to work for their party. With so much Communism about, it was imperative, the Conservatives should be returned.

G. Phillips, spoke in support of the United Nations Association at Electricity House, Erith, on Thursday last week.

</p>, <p>They were “observers” at an International brains trust, organised by Erith U.N.A. Spokesmen for China, South Africa, Russia and U.S.A. took part with Mr. P. H. Ennals, from U.N.A. headquarters, as chairman.

</p>, <p>Mr. Dodds, said the job of world peace could not be left to statesmen alone. The people had to take an interest in it. He had been behind U.N.A. from the beginning and would continue to support it.

</p>, <p>Nations could go on for ever arguing as to “who started what first,” but it was no good going round saying “who-done-it.” Peace would not be won on the battlefields, but in the rice fields.

</p>, <p> “The United States poured thousands of dollars into the Chinese Nationalist Army for weapons, and what good had it done them? How much better it would have been if they had distributed that money among the people on the land,” declared Mr. Dodds, and added: “Whatever one thinks of Communism, one must realise that the people of China looked upon it as liberation from misery.” 

</p>, <p>Miss Roberts (Conservative prospective candidate) stressed that like their national Party leaders, the three local Parties were in complete agreement on the question of the United Nations. When all the nations had the right to “turf their government out when they got fed up with it,” the world would be well on the road towards peace, she said.

</p>, <p>Peace was an essential of Liberalism, said Mr. Phillips (President, Dartford Liberal Association), who detailed UNO, the World Council of Churches, Rotary International and the Scouts as units in the fight for peace.

</p>, <p>Opening the brains trust, Mr. Ennals said the world was facing a grave situation, the full implication of which were not realised in this country. Wherever he went he found serious ignorance of the situation.

</p>, <p>The trust were Mr. K . Lo (China). Mr. Jan Koens (who claimed to have been on every foot of South African soil), Mr. R. N. Cotton (London organiser of the British Soviet Friendship Society) for Russia, and Mr. G. A Cottingham (exchange teacher in Britain for a year) representing the U.S.A.

</p>, <p>The opinions expressed are not necessarily the views of nations, but of the individuals unofficially representing those nations.

</p>, <p><i>First question was whether the Chinese Communists or Nationalists should represent their country at UNO?</i>
</p>, <p>Mr. Lo although he had worked seven years with the Nationalists in Britain, he thought the Communists should have UNO representation. The Nationalists did not represent anybody but themselves, and even then not completely. It also had to be realised that the CommunistGovernment was the most <i>humane</i> (and he emphasised that) his country had had for 50 years.

</p>, <p>Mr. Cotton said that it did not matter how much one disliked Communism, this was a real world in which real things happened. One could not get away from the fact that a great many of people had a Communist Government.

</p>, <p>The chairman agreed with the speakers that the people who represented a country should also represent the majority view.

</p>, <p><i>What should the U.N. policy be if and when its forces reach the 38th parallel?</i>
</p>, <p>Mr. Lo thought that would be the time to stop, for the East could no longer be impressed by material weight, but by morality. The weight of the world was slowly shifting East, so that East and West were becoming equal, but the former still had a lot to learn.

</p>, <p>Miss Cottingham said if she agreed with the President the decision would be left to UNO, but in her opinion it should be decided by the American people.

</p>, <p>Mr. Koens (South Africa) asked the Chinese representative whether there was much difference between South and North Koreans?

</p>, <p> “About as much difference as between Kent and Yorkshire,” replied Mr. Lo, and the chairman commented “That is a deal of difference.” 

</p>, <p>The only solution, thought Mr. Cotton, would be for UNO to hear representatives of the Korean people. It was wrong to think that Stalin could say “stop fighting,” and everybody would down arms just like that.

</p>, <p> “The North Koreans are fighting fanatically, as <i>The Times</i> says; they are fighting bravely, as <i>The Times</i> says, for what they consider their independence. You cannot stop people like that,” declared Mr. Cotton.

</p>, <p>It was wrong to say Russia was arming North Korea, for the Japs had industrialised it so much that they produced their own planes and motor transport. Anybody with a knowledge of chemistry could tell from the descriptions of factories destroyed that North Korea was capable of producing its own means of war.

</p>, <p>Other questions dealt with concerned education, conditions in the Soviet Union and the colour problem. Mr. Koens pointed out that many Africans did not want education, and that it was impossible to Westernise some tribes.

Chairman was Mr. Colin Wolwebber, who was accompanied by Mr. Leslie Baker, Chislehurst Divisional chairman.

</p>, <p>Miss Roberts reminded her audience of some of the constructive points of policy which, she said, had originated from members of the Opposition, but which the Government had allowed a tremendous time-lag to obtain before acting upon them. She highlighted the Atlantic Pact, the Union of Western Europe, and the need for strengthening Britain's armed forces.

</p>, <p> “When you are in such serious danger from a foe whose ultimate purpose is dominate the world, you cannot afford a two or three years' time-lag. Think what two or three years gave Hitler time to do before 1939,” she declared.

</p>, <p>She criticised the Government on “throwing down the drain” the money which had been allocated to defence measures.

</p>, <p> “If Germany were to become another Korea to-night,” she said, “everyone of us would shake in our shoes.” The only thing that allowed Britain time to negotiate, she thought, was her atomic superiority.

</p>, <p>In reply to a question regarding the outlawing of Communists, Miss Roberts said that these measures were against the principles of freedom of the individual for which they had been fighting for the greater part of this century. By pushing Communists underground they would gather strength and a certain amount of martyrdom.

</p>, <p>She felt that an effective measure against Communism might be taken along the lines of the “incitement to disaffection” rule which applied in the Army.

It was for the public in the future to see that U.N.A. continued to go from strength to strength to fulfil the purpose for which it was founded—that we, our children and our children's children should not face the trials and troubles such as had befallen us in the past.

</p>, <p>Canon Elliott Mitchell, president of Dartford U.N.A., was question-master.

</p>, <p> “<i>Is there smouldering in the minds of the German people a desire for world domination, and what would be the effect if German divisions were formed to be borne by their country for</i> <i>[sic]</i>
</p>, <p>Herr Pringsheim, formerly a German lawyer, a refugee from Nazism, and now a naturalised Briton, answered this. One got some idea of what people were thinking (he said) by looking at the results of the Parliamentary elections in Western Germany. In Eastern Germany, of course, there were no free elections. He thought it extremely doubtful if there had ever been any desire for world domination in the minds of the majority of the people of Germany.

</p>, <p>To-day about 60 per cent. of Germans belonged to one of the two main parties, Social Democrats and Christian Democrats. Both these parties were absolutely opposed to any strong foreign policy which might eventually lead to a thirst for domination. They did not want a German Army, but were prepared to take part in the defence of Europe inside a European Army.

</p>, <p>Mr. Reece Palley, an American student now studying at the London School of Economics, answered the next question—

</p>, <p> “<i>What are the views of the man-in-the-street in the U.S.A. on the colossal financial burden being borne by their country for rearmament and relief in various parts of the world?</i>
</p>, <p>He said the States were fortunate in that they had a margin for error, a margin that other peoples did not have. In the States there was always a little bit extra land, a little bit extra in food supplies, a little bit extra active and growing industrial plant. Most of the increased industrial activity was going to come out of surplus capacity. As taxes increased, so would tax returns. The burden on the States would not be too heavy. People there would probably say, “It is a job, and whatever it is going to cost let us get on with it.” 

</p>, <p>Mr. Julian Mitchell, formerly secretary of the League of Coloured People, was asked what he thought of the segregation in South Africa. He thought it contravened all ethical standards and the trust agreed with him.

</p>, <p>After Mr. Timotijevic, a Yugo-Slav journalist, had attempted to answer the next question ( “<i>What—is the difference between Russian and Yugo-Slav Communism?” </i>), Mr. Mitchell put in one of several cogent remarks he made on every question asked during the evening.

</p>, <p>Mr. Timotijevic said the difference between the two conceptions lay in the belief by the Yugo-Slavs that it was possible to exist and develop in accordance with democracy and equality of states and nations; and that Communism could be human. Therefore the Yugo-Slavs deplored the inhumanity of the Russian experiment in Communism, which created the impression throughout the world that Communism was always as practised by the Russians and their satellites.

</p>, <p>Many other questions were asked (some from the audience) and answered, and Miss Margaret Roberts rose to propose an omnibus vote of thanks. She said that in pre-war days it had been difficult to make people listen when one talked about Europe and America. They did not realise that overseas problems concerned them. It helped greatly to have representatives of other countries to speak and to realise how little the citizens of one nation differed, fundamentally, from the citizens of another.

</p>, <p>Mrs. T. Dalby, hon. secretary of the Dartford branch, mentioned that Dartford U.N.A. had joined with the Workers Educational Association in a class held every Thursday at Crayford Library. These meetings afforded the most interesting two hours of the week.

</p>, <p>Elections, she said, were won in the space of time between them, and not during the actual three weeks or so of the fight. It took the Labour Party 50 years to get into power, and they did it by softening up the ground the whole time. Conservatives should learn from their opponents.

</p>, <p>Success lay in the number of keen, willing workers available for canvassing and organisation. They should know where their support lay and where their opponents were, but most important was to know where the doubtful voter was. At present there were not enough seats held by Conservatives to get them in at the next election, so seats had to be wrested from Labour. She concluded, “In this area the Socialists have reached saturation point, but Conservatives can still gain votes.”

</p>, <p>Condemning the present Government's lust for power, she said that Conservatives believed that a government should be the servant of the people and not their ruler.

</p>, <p>We entered 1950 on a wave of mingled hope and fear, and the first wish in all our hearts, was that as the year progressed we should see peace maintained and strengthened. Instead we have seen a series of grave events which has led to a clash of arms. It is this thought which is uppermost in our minds as we stand on the threshold of 1951.

</p>, <p>We have reached a crisis in world history, a crisis which demands swift and certain action. It would be fatal if we as a nation, stood by full of pompous phrases and paper plans, hoping for the best but being unprepared for the worst. We are apt to think that time is on our side, but time is on the side of the nation which uses it to best advantage.

</p>, <p>We believe in the freedom of the democratic way of life. <i>If we serve that idea faithfully with tenacity of purpose, we have nothing to fear from Russian Communism.</i> Indeed it seems more reasonable to assume that it is the Russians who fear the domination of the democratic idea by the way they strive to prevent their people from coming into close contact with it. Communism seizes power by force, not by free choice of the people. The democratic nations must therefore have forces with which to fight it so that choice of government may be free. In the light of these convictions our task is clear. We must firstly <i>believe</i> in the Western way of life and serve it steadfastly. Secondly we must build up our fighting strength to be prepared to defend our ideals, for aggressive nations understand only the threat of force.

</p>, <p>The situation is already grave, but much is possible for a nation with clear intentions and the ability to carry them into action. This must be our first resolve in the New Year.

They paid £1,000 to the first man to discover the process of preserving food, a Frenchman named Nicholas Appert. He did not patent or commercialise his process.

</p>, <p>This was revealed by Miss Margaret Roberts, M.A., B.Sc., (prospective Conservative candidate for Dartford), in a talk to Erith Inner Wheel, at Erith, on January 24.

</p>, <p>Miss Roberts' subject was “Food Research,” and she discussed the various problems which confronted those who studied the science of dietetics and nutrition.

</p>, <p>Appert used glass vessels, she said, while Hall and Donkin were the first to use metal containers. They set up a new factory to carry out their process, thereby giving Britain a completely new industry.

</p>, <p>At first canned food was used in ships only and large contracts were obtained to supply the Royal Navy, while several polar expeditions carried stocks of canned foods.

</p>, <p>One dump of tinned foods (pea soup and beef) was found 87 years later, brought back to England, and when opened in a research laboratory was found to be sound.

</p>, <p>At first everything went smoothly for the new industry, then as it was expanded, difficulties arose. They came up against scientific phenomena. Thus the research chemist began to go back to the source of the raw materials of the canning industry; back to agriculture, because the type of soil, climate and mineral content made a tremendous difference to wheat, or to the vitamin content of vegetables, their toughness, etc. It was the scientist who determined how much fertiliser was needed by the soil to increase the vitamin C content of the produce.

</p>, <p>One discovery was that the state of fatigue of an animal at the time of killing had a direct effect on the toughness of the meat.

</p>, <p>Miss Roberts also spoke of the problems associated with the dried egg. It was found that the chemicals in the white and the yolk warred on each other in the dried state, and so bacteria destroyed the protein in the egg. Consequently, it was necessary to add chemical to fight the bacteria.

</p>, <p> “Do please observe the instructions on the packet of dried egg,” pleaded Miss Roberts, “especially that relating to the time it can be kept.” 

</p>, <p>She also spoke of the determining of particle size in flour, and the elaborate precautions taken to ensure the purity and uniformity of products. Not only did the chemist test raw materials, but tests were made at every stage of the production of foodstuffs and even after production—frequently in conditions similar to those where food was stored in the ordinary household.</p>, <p>Copyright © Margaret Thatcher Foundation 2018.

If a man of 76 could contribute everything he had, what right had they to withhold their services? asked Miss Margaret Roberts, M.A., B.Sc., at Barnehurst, North branch, Dartford Division, Conservative Association, dinner and dance at the Bull Hotel, Dartford, on Friday.

</p>, <p>Mr. R. A. Gommer (chairman) welcomed the visitors, who included Mr. A. E. Allsopp (Divisional Conservative agent and secretary). and Councillor Mrs. H. J. Shand, who was accompanied by her daughter, Sheila. Mrs. Gommer presented Miss Roberts (prospective candidate) with a powder compact on behalf of the branch.

</p>, <p>Mr Gommer said the inaugural meeting had been held 16 months ago, since when the branch had been gradually expanding, due largely to the efforts of Miss Roberts. That dinner was the first function of its kind to be solely organised by a branch. It was a real victory for the Party to have got Mrs. Shand elected to the Council, he said, and he hoped Miss Roberts would be elected to Parliament. He called on Mrs Gommer to present the compact.

</p>, <p>Miss Roberts thanked them for their charming gift, and said that that evening was particularly significant. Exactly a year ago had been the night of her adoption, just before the election, and a year before that she had gone before the selection committee. They had been a happy two years. In the future, if she ever spoke in the House, they would know they had played a part in moulding her and the thoughts she uttered would be their thoughts.

</p>, <p>The party had a long tradition to live up to, not live down, as their opponents suggested, and there were many great men and women in it. The greatest of all was Mr. Churchill. He came to the helm at the age of 66 when most men were thinking of retiring, and was still carrying on.

</p>, <p>When they thought of staying at home instead of attending meetings they should remember this, and that the country was in very serious straits, out of which it could be guided by Mr. Churchill. If a man of 75 could give everything he had to the effort what right had they to withhold their services?

</p>, <p>Miss Roberts congratuated the branch on the good work it had done, and said it was fortunate in its officers.

</p>, <p>Mr. Attlee had referred to Mr Churchill as the “prima donna” of the Conservative Party. Prima donnas were important people, said the speaker, and, when the time came, Mr. Churchill would strike up his refrain, which would be, “O my darling Clem, resign!” (laughter). He would look to them to join in the chorus so they must keep in training.

</p>, <p>The Conservative Party, concluded Miss Roberts, would inevitably come to power again, and when they did the whole country would sing with good reason. “Land of Hope and Glory.”

</p>, <p>The appointment was made at the ward's annual meeting at St. Alban's-road School.

</p>, <p>A bouquet was presented by Mrs. L. F. Chidgey.

</p>, <p>Miss Roberts said the Conservatives were convinced that the tide was running fast with them now and the longer it took for a General Election to come the more certain would be a Conservative victory.

</p>, <p>What particular brand of economics do the Tories favour? Even Marshall agrees with Keynes that taxation and Government spending can “cut down” inflation. If the Government is taking 40 per cent. of earned income in taxation (Margaret Roberts' figures), how on earth does that increase inflation? Surely it is the business of a Government to produce “services” as well as goods? And if “services” only result in inflation, then one must ban all kinds of entertainment, etc., as being “inflationary material.” This taxation goes towards subsidies on food (to keep the prices down), the National Health Services, unemployment benefit, old age pensions, and many other social services, as well as towards the bulk purchase of goods and raw materials.

</p>, <p>As an “amateur economist,” I can only see that if 40 per cent. of earned income is spent by the Government on such things it is tending to reduce inflationary tendencies rather than to increase them, because there is less money to chase the goods.

<span class="comment"><i>Dartford Chronide</i>, 16 March 1951</span> </p>, <p class="mt">Dear Sir,—Your correspondent of last week asked for a brief exposition of the views previously put forward on Government expenditure, taxation policy and inflation.

</p>, <p>The argument that inflation can be caused by excessive taxation is not new; indeed, it has been consistently expounded for the past five years by those who hold high positions in the financial world. It is based on the following reasoning:—

</p>, <p>There are two ways of alleviating inflationary pressure: (1) by increasing production and (2) by reducing spending power. Of these, the former is the real remedy, while the latter is only an expedient. We must consider the effect of high taxation, consequent on high Government expenditure, on both of these factors.

</p>, <p>Firstly, with regard to increasing production, very high taxation reduces incentive to greater effort at all levels, as extra work does not seem worthwhile when the Chancellor of the Exchequer takes such a large slice of the additional earnings. Further, the taxpayer, whether he be wage-earner or salary earner, then naturally presses for an increase in his own income to make up for what he is losing to the Exchequer. The result is inflation, with rising prices and no-one better off than he was before.

</p>, <p>Secondly, the theory that an increase in taxation of a given amount, say £200,000,000, correspondingly reduces spending power by £200,000,000—which it was designed to do—does not hold, as the experience of the past few years has shown. Rather than cut down their standard of living, people draw out their savings and inflation is doubly aggravated.

</p>, <p>Therefore, on both these counts very high taxation produces inflation.

</p>, <p>Your correspondent drags in Keynes' theory, but uses it wrongly. Keynes ' idea was indeed high revenue during the inflationary period of the trade cycle—though not so high as to fail to stimulate greater production. But he postulated that Government expenditure should be less than revenue so that a considerable surplus was saved. It is this saving and not the spending on the part of the Government that acts as a brake on inflation. So on this count, too, it is necessary to reduce the level of civil expenditure if the Keynes' surplus is to be large enough to be effective.

</p>, <p>Of course, I agree with your correspondent that it is the function of the Government to provide services such as pensions, unemployment, insurance, sickness benefit and so on; in fact these things existed long before Socialism came to power. But unless the Exchequer scrutinises expenditure with a view to economy on the non-essentials such as expensive experimental excursions overseas, the resulting inflation will be so great with the new defence programme that the monetary benefits provided under these services will be halved before long. The choice is clear—either the economics are made as a deliberate and selective policy which safeguards the weak and protects the poor, or else there ensues a general inflation cutting savagely and indiscriminately, falling with greatest severity on the old folk and those least able to hear it.

</p>, <p>We shall await the Budget on April 10 with great interest to see what policy the new Chancellor adopts.—Yours faithfully,

<span class="comment">(2) <i>Dartford Chronicle</i>, 30 March 1951</span> </p>, <p class="nonmt">Dear Sir,—Miss Margaret Roberts' letter on economics is interesting. Certainly high taxation encourages inflation, but it is not a bit of use expecting lower taxation, when the nation is committed to spend further thousands of millions on defence, as this necessarily means higher taxation, with its corollaries of higher prices, higher wages, higher profits, higher cost of production. The requirements due to general world rearmament have forced up world commodity prices, and further, there is an acute shortage of raw materials due to United States stockpiling.

</p>, <p>While agreeing that defence expenditure at the present time is necessary, I place such expenditure to a large extent in the same economic category as digging holes and filling them up again. It is wasteful expenditure. The United States spends thousands of millions of dollars on the production of atomic bombs, but will not provide decent housing accommodation for its citizens, many of whom live in shacks which are a disgrace to civilisation. In Russia the position is identical. In Britain the number of houses and schools built is now conditioned by our requirements in men, materials, and money for defence.

</p>, <p>In the realm of public expenditure, what are the things that pay dividends in health, efficiency and happiness? Roughly, they are the provision of houses, schools, hospitals, better educational facilities, roads, electricity, water and a hundred other things. Many of us have lived through two major wars, costing an enormous amount in lives, effort and money. Overseas investments were used to pay for raw materials and food during the last war. The lenders of money for the two wars have to be paid by this and succeeding generations. Astronomical sums now have to be provided by the taxpayer for rearmament.

</p>, <p>We have been subsidising our railways before and since nationalisation. We also subsidise our basic foodstuffs, bread, sugar, butter, meat, etc., to the amount of £400,000,000 per year. The removal of these subsidies from food would cause further inflation. There is also a large subsidy for the development of civil aviation, which is considered important to conserve the skill of designers, technicians, and others in the industry, in view of the transferring of aircraft production to defence needs. It would be a mistake to discontinue all Colonial development expenditure. If the resources of the British Commonwealth had been properly developed when certain empirical gentlemen were in power we should not, as at the present time, have to rely on foreigners to supply us with beef and bacon at any fancy price they choose.

</p>, <p>There is a vast expenditure on atomic experiments. Whether these will be of lasting benefit to mankind is open to question, but we do know that if the atomic bomb is used by both sides, it is likely to kill or main a thousand million people.

</p>, <p>In relation to the conditions I have roughly sketched, I would invite Miss Roberts to be good enough to name the specific items in Government expenditure, where she would make cuts. I could suggest some economics, but the amount saved would be a mere drop in the bucket when compared with the overall budget expenditure, swollen by the enormous cost of defence.—Yours faithfully,

<span class="comment"><i>Dartford Chronicle</i>, 6 April 1951</span> </p>, <p class="mt">Dear Sir,—Further to your correspondent of last week who invited me to give details of possible reductions in Government expenditure. It is not the function of the Opposition to produce a complete alternative budget, but it is their duty to point out to the Government the dangers of very high expenditure. A responsible government would then look for possible cuts itself, but this Government, in the midst of a groundnuts fiasco, a Gambia eggs fiasco (estimated cost of each egg £21!), a meat fiasco (£177 per ton from France and then large quantities had to be condemned as unfit to eat), and various other buying fiascos such as paying the Dutch to keep strawberry pulp which the Ministry of Food had already bought—in the midst of these glaring examples of extravagance and lack of business efficiency, this Government turns round helplessly and says in effect, “Well, we haven't any ideas regarding economics—have you?” 

</p>, <p>Unfortunately full details of administration and expenses are denied to the Opposition and it is therefore impossible to itemise administrative economies in full. But nearly everyone who comes in close touch with any particular branch of the organisation becomes convinced that in the words of Sir Arthur Salter, “its personnel is excessive, and the arrangement of the work extravagant; the highest officials are overburdened with essential work, the waste is elsewhere.” 

</p>, <p>Periodically some dramatic flop reveals to the public a scene of careless preparation, lack of foresight, and extraordinary extravagance. The Minister concerned, instead of honourably resigning as a failure remains complacently incompetent and is kept in office to repeat his mistake. There have been a volley of such revelations during the past year and it is reasonable to infer from what is thus disclosed, the similar character of administration elsewhere. The disturbing thing is that in spite of it all, the Government still blandly continue to waste public money, refusing to admit the possibility of economising; and of course, with their mentality and outlook, and lack of efficiency, public money will never be spent wisely. This business deficiency seems to run through every department, and it is impossible to assess the exact saving until in full possession and control of the facts.

</p>, <p>It is, however, imperative that at this time, when we have to find another £500,000,000 for defence—half of which we trust will be accounted for by increased production—that every possible economy be made before increasing taxes, for this, as your correspondent admits, would produce more inflation. Briefly, the Government is only justified in asking the public to economise if it first sets an example in that direction.—Yours faithfully,

</p>, <p palign="centre">MARGARET H. ROBERTS.

</p>, <p>In what the chairman (Mr. R. Jackson) described as “the best speech I have heard,” she flayed the Government housing policy and accused them of “betraying the people.” 

</p>, <p>The greatest social service on the Conservative programme was housing, for national conditions would not improve until the people were fully housed, she said. All the money spent on education was wasted if youngsters did not have a decent home background.

</p>, <p>When Conservatives set their target of 300,000 houses it was greeted with approval from members of all political parties. The Minister of Works was reported as saying in October: “We are building 200,000 houses a year, but that could be increased by 15 per cent. …” Building trade union officials also had agreed that more houses could be built.

</p>, <p>What did it take to build a house, asked Miss Roberts? About 20,000 bricks, 9½ tons of cement and a quantity of timber. To build 300,000 houses, then, 6,000,000,000 bricks would be needed—only three-quarters of the pre-war brick production.

</p>, <p>Builders would require 3,000,000 tons of cement, which was merely a third of Britain's present production, although output would have to be stepped up to maintain the export figure. As for timber, there was no world shortage.

</p>, <p>The secret of building houses was to have the right materials at the right places at the right time, contended Miss Roberts.

</p>, <p>The candidate concluded: “We are confident that we can house the people by building 300,000 houses a year. If we are elected and find we can reach that figure we will then try to surpass it.” </p>, <p>Copyright © Margaret Thatcher Foundation 2018. All Rights Reserved.
        </p>][<p id="section">Speeches, Interviews &amp; Other Statements</p>, <p id="description">Complete list of 8,000+ Thatcher statements &amp; texts of many of them</p>, <p class="nonmt">Miss Margaret Roberts told Dartford Division Conservative Association at their annual meeting at the Bull Hotel, Dartford, on Tuesday, that they must be prepared, if need be, for an election at the end of May or the first week in June.

</p>, <p>They were dealing with uncertainties they had not dreamed would happen last week, when they did not think there would be two Cabinet resignations, she continued. The Cabinet was crumbling away; four prominent members had been lost to the Government in Sir Stafford Cripps, Mr. Bevin, Mr. Bevan and Mr. Wilson.

</p>, <p>If they were to analyse the situation to see what was likely to happen they must try and put themselves in the shoes of those who were in power. The question they had to decide was this: Was it better for them to go now, with an obvious split in the Labour Party just starting? If they hung on, would that rift be closed or would it widen? If it widened the better would be the victory for the Tories in the end.

</p>, <p>The Tories should regard this period more than ever before as a prelude to victory, and they had to prepare themselves for the responsibility of power. She was certain that when they were returned there would be no spirit of “We are the masters now,” and it was in that attitude, both nationally and locally, that they must regard the situation.

</p>, <p>The split had undoubtedly been simmering for a long time, and perhaps one of the most obvious things about it was that it was a split of personal jealousies, as well as political differences. When that occurred, then, indeed, the party in power was divided in perhaps the strongest way possible, and when personal jealousies came into politics, then the Government was no longer the Government to run the country.

</p>, <p>Officers elected were: President, Mr. Morris Wheeler; vice-president, Mr. J. Panton; chairman, Mr. J. L. M. Miller; vice-chairmen, Mr. Hugh Goff, Mr. J. Gates, Mr. Gordon Waterman and Mrs. D. M. Fletcher; hon. treasurer, Mr. Hugh Goff; hon. auditor, Mr. Hedley Dunk.

That is obviously because that subject is the basis not only of our national life, but of the life of the world to-day.” 

</p>, <p>Miss Margaret Roberts, prospective Conservative candidate for Dartford, said this when addressing Dartford Free Church Federal Council at their annual meeting at Spital-street Methodist Church on May 30. The speaker was to have been Sir Richard Acland, M.P., but he was detained in the House. Mr. Norman Dodds, M.P., was also detained.

</p>, <p>The Rev. H. Austin Fairhurst (retiring president) said that Sir Richard and Miss Roberts had been asked to come to the meeting not because of any party label, but because of their sound Christian convictions.

</p>, <p>In welcoming Miss Roberts and the Mayoress of Dartford (Mrs. F. M. E. Firman), he said they were fortunate in having a Mayor and Mayoress of the calibre of Mr. and Mrs. Firman, and were delighted they were to carry on for another 12 months.

</p>, <p>After the address by Miss Roberts Dr. T. S. Cochrane was instituted as new president of the Council.

</p>, <p>Miss Roberts based her address on a text from Genesis— “‘Per-adventure ten shall be found there,’ and the Lord said. ‘I will not destroy it for ten's sake.’” She had chosen that text because at the outset one could see from the Old Testament the importance to civilisation of a small minority of righteous men. Had those ten righteous men been found they could have saved the cities from destruction.

</p>, <p>It was not the last time that the future of cities and the world depended on a few men. It occurred again in the New Testament, when it was not ten men, but twelve. Had there not been those twelve the Christian faith would never have been propagated.

</p>, <p>In their own life-time it depended on the few men of the Battle of Britain to save civilisation from immediate doom.

</p>, <p>To-day, with all the trouble and tribulation in the world, the future of the world depended on the few men and women who were Christians and who were willing to practise and propagate that faith abroad.

</p>, <p>The Church's influence during the past years had been far wider than was apparent to most people, and to-day it was far wider than many would believe.

</p>, <p>It had given to all life a standard of values from which no person should consciously try to deviate—a standard which was above all else, above all political parties, and which was, in fact, a code of principles based on man's purpose in the world and his relationship with God.

</p>, <p>Considering how they could present a united front to the outside world, she said small things divided them, but the whole time these must be seen in perspective against the really big things which did unite them. However irritating the small things became at times they must see them in relation to the big things, and then they would find they faded into insignificance and they would be able to present a united front to those people outside their bounds.

</p>, <p>They should take their ideals and their creed into all other organisations outside the Church, into national and local government. When one knew a person was a Christian one could expect a decent standard of behaviour from them. For Christians to stay out of that side of life was to let non-practising Christians in, and that would be quite wrong.

</p>, <p>In thanking all who had worked with him on the council, Mr. Fairhurst said that as Free Churches they had drawn closer together during the last twelve months.

</p>, <p>Introducing the new president, he said he had always thought how fortunate that town was to have so great a company of Christian doctors. He was glad they could invite one of them to be president.

</p>, <p>Mr. Fairhurst then handed Dr. Cochrane the presidential Bible.

</p>, <p>Dr. Cochrane paid tribute to Mr. Fairhurst who, he said, had carried out his duties magnificently. Unfortunately they were not only losing him as president but losing him shortly from Dartford.

</p>, <p>She complimented Mr. J.F.L. Gates on his recent election to the Council, and warned her listeners that the years 1952–3 would be the “most crucial” with regard to foreign affairs.

</p>, <p>After commenting on the excellence of the dinner, Miss Roberts said the political machine was going through a busy time and no one knew when the General Election would be. Nothing seemed to shift the Government, so great were their “adhesive powers,” and one of the best ways of getting them out was to win by-elections. The Erith area was a good barometer of public opinion because it was not a Conservative area, and she was often asked, “How is it going?” It was with great delight that she could say it had been possible to put a Conservative on the Council.

</p>, <p>Miss Roberts congratulated Mr. Gates on his election and said she was happy to see other members of the Council present, who, though they did not sit under the Conservative flag, were more inclined to the ultra-violet end of the spectrum rather than the infra-red. She hoped that dinner would become an annual affair.

</p>, <p>Nothing the leaders of the party could do would be worth anything unless they were backed up by individual members of the party.

</p>, <p></p>, <p>If Russia wanted to make war she would have to do it in those years because her armed strength would be more or less up to ours. After that period American technical lead would increase.

</p>, <p>Miss Roberts was replying to the toast to “The Guests,” proposed by Mr. W. J. Harding (prospective candidate for Old Church Ward).

</p>, <p>Mr. Gates said one could win elections only by organisation, and the first thing the Conservatives would do when they had won the election would be to encourage competition in farms, firms and factories, and cut out Government spending.

</p>, <p>Iron and steel would be freed and more local control given to coal. Above all, they intended to build houses. In spite of what Mr. Norman Dodds had said they would still keep 300,000 houses a year as their target. The situation in the area was dreadful, and provided there was no war the Conservatives would improve that position. The anti-Socialists vote in Dartford Division was now greater than the Socialist, he declared.

</p>, <p>The only answer to Socialist lies was the truth, said Mr. A. E. Allsopp (Conservative agent), and he quoted a story which he said was circulating about Mr. Churchill. This stated that if he (Mr. Churchill) returned to power the country would be at war with Russia in six weeks. Mr. Churchill, said the speaker, had never been in power at the beginning of any war which had occurred during his lifetime.

</p>, <p>Mr. J.W. Panton (vice-president, Dartford Division) said he was glad there was a branch in Erith to which a toast could be given. The branch had a tough assignment and had made a good start in getting Mr. Gates elected.</p>, <p>Copyright © Margaret Thatcher Foundation 2018. All Rights Reserved.

They are more interested in the Festival of Britain than the oil question,” said Miss Margaret Roberts, M.A., B.Sc., when she spoke at a meeting of Belvedere South Ward Conservatives at the club on June 27.

</p>, <p>Lack of speed and strength had complicated the position in which we found ourselves, continued Miss Roberts.

</p>, <p>Councillor J. Gates was among those present and Mr. D. Cunningham presided.

</p>, <p>The first indication that something serious would happen in Persia with regard to the oil came on March 15. It was not until eight weeks later that the Government did anything about it, declared Miss Roberts.

</p>, <p>She asked her listeners to consider how quickly events had moved in the last fortnight and how much valuable time had been wasted. The opening of the Festival of Britain had occurred about that time and the Government had shown a greater interest in that than in Persia.

</p>, <p>The Persians had no strong men with democratic principles in power and many of the people lived in squalor. Ruthless men in Persia had laid the blame for that on the British. The truth was the British had done nothing but good for the Persians. Employees of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company were among the best housed and provided for in the country. At present we stood to lose the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company plant which was worth £360,000,000, half a pre-war budget.

</p>, <p>The Persians would never have dared to act as they had if we had been strong. Eastern people were very quick to sense vacillation. The British should have had a Middle Eastern pact with the Americans, for one or two countries have realised that the British Government would not act quickly or strongly and took advantage of it.

</p>, <p>It was the function of a government to try, with all the information at their disposal, to forsee what is going to happen and if they default in this respect they are not doing their job.

</p>, <p>People should never think of foreign affairs as being remote because, sooner or later, they had an impact on people personally. Korea was not the only place in the Far East where there was trouble. In China the régime of Chiang Kai Shek had been corrupt and when the Communists took over everyone had said they were working wonders.

</p>, <p>The true nature of Communism was coming out now, however, and there had been 1,000,000 people executed without proper trial. No democratic country could stand by and watch this going on.

</p>, <p>France was having trouble in Indo-China and if that country fell, Siam would go and then Singapore and Malaya. Our Naval base would be lost and Australia and New Zealand would be cut off. Communism would spread through Malaya into Burma and India, which bordered Russia. It was vital we held what we had in the Far East.

</p>, <p>Mr. Churchill had been called a war-monger, but no one had done more to build up the strength of the armed forces between the wars as a defence against war. For the Socialists to say so was merely a vote catching device.

</p>, <p>The war-mongers were those who let things slide and hoped for the best. They should remember everyone went into battle now-a-days.</p>, <p>Copyright © Margaret Thatcher Foundation 2018. All Rights Reserved.

</p>, <p>She referred when opening the annual garden party at the lovely house and grounds of Broomfields, Wilmington, to the continual reminders which were always being made with regard to a possible election at any time. She admitted that in the summer months it was a temptation to forget all about politics. This lapse of memory was not confined to the politicians, but also affected those who were not so actively concerned. Miss Roberts urged her listeners to spare a thought for the Members closeted in the House during the good weather.

</p>, <p>Thanking Mrs. B. Waterman (president) for lending Broom-fields for the garden party, Miss Roberts pointed out that it was not actually in the Dartford Division. “I warn Chislehurst, however,” she said, “that if there is a re-distribution of seats we should want this to come into the Dartford Division.” 

</p>, <p>Mrs. D. Fletcher (chairman of the women's section of the Divisional Association) proposed a vote of thanks to Miss Roberts. Mrs. A. M. Jenns (chairman of the Dartford Women's Branch) was chairman at the opening.

</p>, <p>Thirteen-years-old Connie Esson presented Miss Roberts with some rare Indian brasswork. The pieces consisted of a fruit dish and a bell, hand engraved and painted.

</p>, <p>Miss Roberts commented on the fact that the Dartford ladies were always original in their choice of gifts. She had set up bachelor girl housekeeping, “and the only trouble is that with such a position there is only one to collect the weekly purchases—instead of two.” </p>, <p>Copyright © Margaret Thatcher Foundation 2018.

So said the Radio Doctor (Dr. Charles Hill, M.P. for Luton) at the gala and rally arranged at Dartford's Central Park on Saturday by the joint Conservative associations of Chislehurst, Dartford and Orpington.

</p>, <p>Dr. Hill was speaking from a platform which included Miss Margaret Roberts, prospective Conservative candidate for Dartford (as chairman), Miss Pat Hornsby-Smith, M.P. for Chislehurst, Sir Waldron Smithers, M.P. for Orpington, Mr. Edward Heath, M.P. for Bexley, the chairmen of the three associations, Miss Beryl Cook (Central Office agent, S.E. Area), the Hon. W. S. Philipps (hon. treasurer, gala), Mr. J. D. Read (vice-chairman of Kent County Conservative Council), and Mr Charles Knight (hon. secretary, gala).

</p>, <p>Miss Roberts welcomed the people in the Pavilion Enclosure. She referred to the work put in by the chairman of the Fete Committee (Mr. John Miller, who is chairman of the Dartford Conservative Association) and the chairmen of the other divisional associations (Mr. H. W. Rose, Orpington, and Mr. Edward Moore, Chislehurst). After introducing the Conservative Members for Chislehurst, Orpington and Bexley, Miss Roberts described Dr. Hill as the star turn and mentioned his “magnetism.” 

</p>, <p>She said there was a large floating vote in the divisions represented at the rally, and one of the big things which had influenced voters had been the broadcasts of Dr. Hill.

</p>, <p>The Radio Doctor said he was particularly glad to be at the rally as he was reinforced on the platform by Sir Waldron Smithers ( “The grand old fighter in the Conservative cause” ), by “Ted” Heath ( “one of our schoolmasters—a junior whip” ), by Pat Hornsby-Smith ( “who has brought to the House a charm and ability and an enlivenment which is sorely needed” ) and Miss Roberts ( “let us hope she will come along to join the night shift” ).

</p>, <p>Dr. Hill wondered on what issues the Socialist Party would fight the General Election. Would they explain how it was that Aneurin Bevan had said that every family would have a separate dwelling by last year? Would it be the “success” of nationalistion? The socialists now had a past. Gone were the days when they could promise Utopia. Now they had been seen in action and the electorate could judge by what it had seen.

</p>, <p>More and cheaper coal had been promised after nationalisation. The planning boys, with their corduroy trousers and curly pipes, had worked out how much coal the country could afford to export last year, and things had worked out all right in the first part of the year. Then, however, they had found that they had remembered everything but the weather and had allowed too much to go for export. Did one remember the “magnificent change” which had come over the railways, gas and electricity supplies after nationalisation? Would the Socialists mention nuts? They might even tell of the egg scheme in Gambia.

</p>, <p>The Socialists had promised a brave new world (said the Doctor) and they did not think they had failed. And yet the story of the past six years was a dismal one of appalling failure in the nationalised industries, a story of a cost of living which had been rising long before Korea, a story of failure in housing.

</p>, <p>What then would be the cry? Dr. Hill suggested that there were at the moment two—the Attlee Cry and the Bevan Cry. One was not sure which it was going to be. The Doctor said he had forgotten what one called those animals which left sinking ships, but he did know that Mr. Bevan was dusting a seat for himself on the front Opposition Bench.

</p>, <p>The Government had determined reluctantly but inevitably that the defence of this country had to be strengthened.

</p>, <p>When the Prime Minister told the people that we needed closer association with the United States of America and that we needed to strengthen our defences, he had the support of His Majesty's Opposition, said Dr. Hill. In the House a group of Socialists sit pale and silent and then go ont into the country delivering themselves of such gems as “What are we doing in Hong Kong and Malaya.” 

</p>, <p>There were some people (claimed Dr. Hill) who thought we were possessed of the worst Foreign Minister this country had ever known—one who would be better fiddling with cups of tea on the South Bank than grappling with the problems of the day in foreign affairs. Later, Dr. Hill asked whether the country would be better served by Mr. Herbert Morrison or by Mr. Anthony Eden. He supposed that most Members of the House, politics apart, would rather see Mr. Eden in the position. <span class="page">[end p1]</span>
</p>, <p>In home affairs the electorate had many issues on which to judge the Government's success or failure. So far (said Dr. Hill) he had not mentioned meat. In the “bad old days” when the experienced men had bought the meat there had been plenty for everyone. Now ambassadors were on the job! The farce of it all was in the underlying assumption that a few people had the capacity and the knowledge to do better than free enterprise working with the impulse of private profit. The Socialists' election manifesto was being got ready and in that they were certainly hoping to divert the people of the country by blaming profits for loss. The Socialists were calling the Conservatives a war-mongering party. This was what they called one who stood up for freedom. When the world began to see the happenings in Egypt, certain South American republics and in Persia they would see the danger of a conflagration breaking out all over the world.

</p>, <p> “I believe the real war-mongers are the Socialist Party themselves,” declared Dr. Hill. “They have lowered the prestige of Britain, and would cripple the iron and steel of this country despite the failures of nationalisation elsewhere. I suggest that the task of the people is to put their hands on their hearts and think. Can they swear that nationalisation has raised the efficiency of industries and the standard of life of the people?

</p>, <p>Dr. Hill was of the opinion that the sooner the people got a chance to change the Government the better it would be. Of course, the Government of the day hesitated—they knew what the result would be. At election-time the people would have a chance of electing in the Conservative Party a same and sensible Government which would put the interests of England where they belonged and give the country a chance to restore itself to its rightful position in the world.

</p>, <p> “Be on your guard,” warned Dr. Hill. “Let us between now and the election take our politics a bit more seriously. The real issue before the people of this country next time is between two ways of life—a way dominated by the State with an increasing number of people servants of the State; and a way of life in a State where no men shall fall below a proper level and can rise above that level if they have the capacity.” 

</p>, <p>Miss Hornsby-Smith, proposing a vote of thanks, said that Dr. Hill was our nearest equivalent to a “modern John Bull.”

Members of Dartford Conservative Association—350 of them—went to Church Hall, Lowfield-street, to adopt Miss Margaret Roberts, M.A., B.Sc., as their candidate for the coming General Election.

</p>, <p>So that they would not miss the speech of their leader, it was decided that a radio set should be installed on the platform. The business of the meeting was over by 9.12 p.m., and immediately afterwards the wireless was switched on. Mr. Churchill 's speech brought forth rounds of applause.

</p>, <p>After the singing of “Land of Hope and Glory,” the chairman of the Divisional Party (Mr. J. L. Miller) asked the meeting to express their good wishes to Miss Roberts' father and mother, who were unfortunately unable to be there that evening. Miss Roberts, it was hoped, would have a speedy recovery from her illness.

</p>, <p>Mr. Miller then read a letter from Mr. Churchill addressed to Miss Roberts, but intended for the electors of Dartford. It read as follows:—

</p>, <p> “On October 25 you will have to make a fateful decision. Your action that day will determine the fortunes of our country for the next five years.

</p>, <p> “The nation needs a new government. It is because Socialism has collapsed that a General Election is now taking place. Grave difficulties lie ahead which must be faced squarely. Peace and prosperity can only be secured by exertion and self-denial. Only a strong and progressive government which seeks to unite the nation instead of dividing it, and to encourage our national qualities of thrift, hard work and enterprise, can lead us through these troubled times.

</p>, <p> “We make no easy promises. Our published policy sets forth the methods by which we intend, if returned to power, to tackle the urgent problems which confront us.

</p>, <p> “Miss Margaret Roberts is pledged to support this policy, which I commend to you. I ask you to give her your vote on October 25 in the full confidence that she will faithfully discharge her duties at Westminster in your interests and those of the nation as a whole.” 

</p>, <p>Mr. Miller pointed out that it was 10 or 11 years since the party had been fortunate enough to enter a campaign with a candidate who had previously fought a campaign in the Division. It would be remembered that Mr. Frank Clarke had fought it many times. The chairman referred to the “wonderful show” put up by Miss Roberts at the last election, and said the fact that she had agreed to stand at Dartford again showed that she had the greatest possible confidence in the people of the Division.

</p>, <p>Miss Roberts opened her speech with the words, “The time for which we have all been steadily working during the past months has now at last arrived, and we have the opportunity very shortly to show at the polls all the work which we have been doing and the result which the policy of the Government has had upon the country—a result which we hope will achieve a tremendous Conservative victory. Had the election not come we should at this moment have been preparing to go to the great Conservative Conference. Perhaps Mr. Attlee and his friends were afraid of the rallying effect it would have had. We shall show up quite ruthlessly how and where the Government have gone wrong in home and foreign affairs. Undoubtedly the date of the election was chosen very carefully so that our Conference could not go before the ears of the public and so that their Conference would not show the full extent of the split within the Socialist Party.” 

</p>, <p>Miss Roberts believed that this time the Conservatives could call the tune. It was not on little things alone that the Socialists had failed. They had failed all round on the big issues.

</p>, <p>If the Conservatives go in there would be every reason to face the future with assured hope, she thought. The big issues had therefore to be kept in front of the electorate. The “fear” campaign of the Socialists had already started—they were fighting on what they said would happen if the Conservatives were returned.

</p>, <p>The most serious aspect of the situation was the Socialist Insistence that the Conservatives were warmongers. Nothing could be further from the truth. No political party could have done more in the years between the wars to try and preserve peace.

</p>, <p>And in the forefront had been Mr. Churchill and Mr. Eden. They failed because perhaps too many people listened too closely to the things some people said, people who advised the laying down of the weapons of war. Such advice had been proved worthless. The whole of the Conservative rearmament policy was directed towards negotiating with strong aggressors from a strong nation here. They believed it could be done. Then this nation could go forward building up in the future as she had always built up in the past. If the Socialist policy were allowed to continue we would be taken closer and closer to war.

</p>, <p>Recently Great Britain had suffered a most grievous blow when all our assets in Persia had been given away. We could ill-afford to lose prestige in these days. The question had been asked, “What would the Tories have done?” Miss Roberts pointed out that in 1932 a similar sort of thing had happened in Persia. Within 20 days the case had been given to the International court and taken to the League of Nations. A settlement was speedily negotiated.

</p>, <p>There was no talk of war then because a Conservative administration was in power and dealt with the situation quickly and firmly. This time it had taken eight months before it went to the Security Council, and when Mr. Stokes had returned no further action had been taken. No reply had been sent to the last Persian Note, and the Socialists had waited for something to turn up at the last moment saving them from their folly.

</p>, <p>The Conservatives (said Miss Roberts) had always been the party of the British Common-wealth and Empire. During the last few years they had seen the steady deterioration and breaking down of trade and imperial preferences. “If we can co-operate on matters of defence through the Empire and the U.S., and so to greater things, we can defend the world on a world basis,” claimed the speaker. “The hope of this nation as a future trading nation stands on co-operation and trading with our own dominions and colonies. We shall shortly be facing some Japanese and German competition, and we must seek our first markets in the colonies and also be the first markets so far as they are concerned.” 

</p>, <p>The greatest of the social difficulties would undoubtedly be that of housing. Many gibes had been made at the target put forward by the Conservatives of 300,000 houses a year. That target still stood, said Miss Roberts. Priority had to be given somewhere on a programme, and that of the Conservatives—after the needs of defence—would be the reaching of the 300,000 houses target.

</p>, <p>Councillor John Gates, vice-chairman of the Divisional Party, proposed “That this general meeting … hereby adopts Miss Margaret Roberts, M.A., B.Sc., as the Conservative candidate for the constituency, and pledges itself to use every legitimate means to secure her return.” The resolution was seconded by Mrs. E. M. Jenns, and was carried. <span class="page">[end p1]</span>

<span class="comment">(2) <i>Gravesend and Dartford Reporter</i>, 13 October 1951</span> </p>, <p class="nonmt">Miss Margaret Roberts, 26 to-morrow, made one of the finest speeches of her political career when she was adopted Conservative candidate for the Dartford Division by a packed crowd in the Church Hall, Lowfield-street, on Monday evening.

</p>, <p>After a slashing attack on the Socialists for their failures over the past six years, she said the Tories would reap a bitter harvest but they were not afraid to reap it.

</p>, <p> “Under the Socialists,” she declared, “this country will never really pay its way. It will go from one crisis to another and eventually come to such an enormous crash that Britain will go out of existence as Great Britain once and for all.” 

</p>, <p>Miss Roberts said the Conservatives would face up to the situation and put into operation a sound financial policy under men who had been used for years to dealing conscientiously with other people's money.

</p>, <p>Talking about the cost of living, Miss Roberts commented “Surely there is something wrong with Government expenditure when it results in anomalies such as we have seen during the time the Socialists have been in power.” 

</p>, <p>The money spent on the ground nuts scheme, for instance, could have provided 25,000 local authority houses. Under the Socialists it cost four times as much to train a fireman as it did to send a boy to a university. The amount which the Government spent on converting locomotives from coal to oil and back again would have paid a quarter of the railway-men's increased claims last year. The amount they spent on maintaining Government hostels would have bought a pair of shoes for every child of school age in the country.

</p>, <p> “I hope those examples will give you some idea of the amount of money that has been steadily going away,” Miss Roberts said. “Translated into terms of £ s. d. it means that we have paid the Government 5d. out of every shilling we earn.” 

</p>, <p>Had the election not come at the present time, the Conservatives would have been preparing to go to their great conference at Scarborough, Miss Roberts said. Perhaps Mr. Attlee and his friends were afraid of the rallying effect that would have had on the country. “I think they were,” she said, “because we should have shown up quite ruthlessly where the Government have gone wrong in their policy at home and in foreign affairs in the last few months. And what a showdown it would have been!

</p>, <p> “Undoubtedly the date of the election was chosen very carefully so that our conference could not come before the ears of the public and so that their own would not show the full extent of the split within the Socialist Party. They are undoubtedly afraid to reap the bitter harvest which will be the result of the seeds they have sown in recent months.” 

</p>, <p>It was not in the little things alone that the Socialists had failed. They had failed all round on the bigger issues. These were some of Miss Roberts' points:

</p>, <p>Socialist charge of war-mongering: “We have no thoughts of plunging this nation into war. We want peace through strength so that Britain can build up in the future as she did in the past.” 

</p>, <p>Persia: “The greatest blow of all to our prestige in foreign fields.” 

</p>, <p>The Empire: “We believe in the future of the Empire and on return to power we shall call an economic and defence conference so that we do not pay merely lip service to the Empire but practise more practical ties of friendship in the way of direct consultations and trade.” 

</p>, <p>Housing: “We have had many Socialist jibes at our proposal to put up 300,000 houses a year. That target stands.” 

</p>, <p>Miss Roberts said the Conservatives believed that they could provide the leadership to make Britain great again. They felt that on October 26th they would be able to celebrate a magnificent Conservative victory. It would be a victory that would be celebrated no only in this country but in countries beyond the seas.

</p>, <p> “We believe,” she said in conclusion, “that our policy carried out under our <span class="nm">Winston Churchill</span>great leader, courageously and without any shadow or element of despair, will bring Great Britain out of the abyss she is in and take us once again to the heights we can attain.” 

</p>, <p>Mr. John Miller, Chairman of the Divisional Party, presided and the meeting was addressed by journalist Ken Johnson. Afterwards, the great audience listened to Winston Churchill 's broadcast speech.</p>, <p>Copyright © Margaret Thatcher Foundation 2018. All Rights Reserved.
        </p>][<p id="section">Speeches, Interviews &amp; Other Statements</p>, <p id="description">Complete list of 8,000+ Thatcher statements &amp; texts of many of them</p>, <p class="mt">On October the 25th you will have the right to choose a new House of Commons. As the Conservative Candidate for the Dartford Constituency this is the policy which I support.

</p>, <p>Every Conservative desires peace. The threat to peace comes from Communism, which has powerful forces ready to attack anywhere. Communism waits for weakness, it leaves strength alone. Britain therefore must be strong, strong in arms, and strong in faith in her own way of life. The greatest hope for peace lies in friendship and co-operation with the United States of America. Conservative Policy is to set up an organisation similar to the wartime Combined Chiefs of Staff. Defence experts could then review the claims of one area against those of another.

</p>, <p>British assets in Persia have been thrown away by the weakness of the Socialist Government. Our prestige in the Middle East could not be lower. Conservatives will guard the interests of Britain and liberty everywhere.

</p>, <p>Conservatives believe in the future of the British Commonwealth and Empire. We shall aim at trading as much as possible within the Empire. We uphold the right to grant and receive preferences for Empire goods. We need more raw materials to maintain full employment and the Colonies are valuable sources of these. A Conservative Government will call an Empire Economic Conference of representatives from the Dominions and Colonies so that we can work out a trading policy together. Further, we shall establish a Commonwealth Defence Council so that we may act in harmony with one another in matters of World Defence.

</p>, <p>There is no single solution that will rapidly reduce the cost of living. The programme of the new Government will be judged according to its effect on rising prices. After six years of Socialism £1 is worth only 14/9. Conservatives will follow a sound financial policy and will spend public money wisely. This will help to make the pound worth more at home and abroad. Harder work and greater production are the real remedies for the high cost of living. A Conservative Government will help by reducing taxes on profits ploughed back into industry. This should enable our industries to expand, and machinery and equipment to be kept up-to-date.

</p>, <p>There is no truth in the Socialist scare that the Tories want unemployment. The nation must have prosperous industries, and must export sufficient goods to live. Times of high prosperity <span class="page">[end p1]</span> are times of full employment. As we require increased production there is not likely to be any shortage of jobs.

</p>, <p>Management and wage earners alike have a common interest in the future of their industry. The Conservative way is to have a fair deal for all. Extra skill deserves extra reward.

</p>, <p>Free and independent Trade Unions are an essential part of industry. On being returned to power Conservatives will confer with the leaders of the Trade Union movement on economic and labour problems.

</p>, <p>Provision of houses is the most urgent social service of all. It will be the duty of a Conservative Government to spare no effort to increase the number of houses built per year. After the needs of Defence have been met we shall give housing priority over all other forms of building. We believe that if the private builder is given freedom to build small houses, the target of 300,000 a year can be achieved. That number has been built under a Conservative Government before and it can be done again.

</p>, <p>Finally, we Conservatives recognise that times will be hard this winter. There is a fuel crisis approaching and the nation is facing difficulties with its export trade. We shall tackle these problems courageously, and with the British people firmly behind us, we believe we can overcome them.

To her delighted surprise she received bouquets of flowers at an informal presentation ceremony at the Conservative headquarters in Spital-street, Dartford, that morning.

</p>, <p>Afterwards she made a tour of the Conservative clubs, meeting well-wishers who all did their best to make her birthday a happy one. The short respite from election cares now over, she is continuing with her programme of meetings in all parts of the Division.

</p>, <p>Miss Roberts told the people gathered at the headquarters on Saturday that her agent (Mr. A. E. Allsopp) had ordered her to come along—without divulging any information about a presentation. As any good candidate should do, she had obeyed him. Mrs. Jenns, vice chairman of the Women's Advisory Council, presented her with a hat-box and week-end case from the women of the Division. There were also many birthday cards and greetings telegrams.

</p>, <p>Given the hat-box, Miss Roberts commented, “I love hats, but I have never possessed a hat-box.” 

</p>, <p>Flowers were given her from friends in St. Alban's Ward, Brent Ward, and a family of eight Conservatives. Mr. Allsopp, on behalf of himself and his staff, gave her a bouquet of red roses, and one association member, looking at the colours of Miss Roberts' rosette, murmured, “Red roses for a blue lady!” 

</p>, <p>Sir Herbert Williams, former M.P. for Croydon East, spoke at St. Alban's Hall, Dartford, on Friday, to a packed house. He started by pointing out that the following day would be the anniversary of Miss Roberts birth. She would be the same age as Mr. Winston Churchill was when first elected to Parliament.

</p>, <p>Every election was important but none had ever been more important than this one, said Sir Herbert. This was D-Day—a day of destiny for Great Britain. Unless a Conservative Government was returned Sir Herbert feared for the future of the country.

</p>, <p>The first heckle from the audience came after Sir Herbert had started on the Persian and Egyptian questions. He had just asked “Can you imagine that the Persians would have treated us as they have done if Mr. Churchill had been Prime Minister?” and was going on to say that it was a favourite cry of the Socialists that the Tories would have gone to war, when just such a comment was made from the back of the hall. Sir Herbert said that Socialists had condemned the idea of the “imperialistic gun-boat!” Then why had they sent a cruiser? To be looked at? Of course the Conservative Party did not want war. They did not believe that the way to prevent war was to lie down and be kicked by every inferior creature who came along.

</p>, <p>Sir Herbert said that had it not been for Britain there would never have been an independent Egypt, and it would have been a province of Turkey. Lord Cromer was the great man who had created modern Egypt. Disraeli had bought shares in the Suez Canal during Victoria's reign and since that day millions of pounds had come from those shares. If the passage through Suez were to be interrupted then the effect would be seen even in Dartford.

</p>, <p>Our reserves of dollars and gold had undergone a serious decline. Unless something was done about it we were going to have a very unpleasant time. Civilised life could not be carried on unless there was a sufficiency of coal, electricity and gas. To-day the position with regard to electricity was deplorable. Administration had been incompetent—there had even been cuts in summer-time. The time would come when domestic and factory life would be affected not only by shortage of coal but most of all by shortage of generating plant and boilers.

</p>, <p>When he commented “Everything that has been nationalised has been a flop,” a voice from the back called “What about the coal mines?” Said Sir Herbert, “Yes, what about them! They are producing less coal with more modern equipment than before the war under private enterprise.” 

</p>, <p>There was going to be a fuel crisis and even if the Conservatives could return to power within 24 hours there would not be time to stop it. Things were definitely going to get worse before they got better, Mr. Attlee having thought it better to get out before things got too bad. “They want to hand over the unwashed baby to us,” said Sir Herbert.

</p>, <p>Turning to the question of Russia and what he described as “the complete failure of this Government to come to any terms with the Russian Government,” Sir Herbert said “Here we have first-class crooks in the Kremlin. We know they are crooks and that you cannot accept as accurate any statement made by a Russian statesman. And what blackguards these Communists are. They only take orders from Moscow. I understand that a certain number of fellow travellers are supporting the Socialist candidate for this Division.” 

</p>, <p>Sir Herbert referred to “the lies of the Socialists,” instancing those <span class="page">[end p1]</span> statements which alleged that National Service would be increased to three years and that old age pensions would be taken away if the Conservatives got in. He then gave a short history of pensions in this country, finishing up by saying that the Labour Government as such did not even introduce family allowances, which had been approved by Mr. Churchill when he was Prime Minister in National Government.</p>, <p>Copyright © Margaret Thatcher Foundation 2018.

        </p>][<p id="section">Speeches, Interviews &amp; Other Statements</p>, <p id="description">Complete list of 8,000+ Thatcher statements &amp; texts of many of them</p>, <p> “One of the best of the campaign,” was how Miss Roberts described her meeting at Bedon-well-hill Primary School, Belvedere, on Monday, when a crowded audience overflowed outside the building.

</p>, <p>She told them, “We are living in days when people talk much more about rights than responsibilities. That is not typical of our nation and everyone, at any and every level, who is prepared to say, ‘I have a right to this or that,’ must also say, ‘I have a responsibility towards myself, my family and my country, and that responsibility, whoever I may be, is to do all in my power to see that Britain achieves the maximum greatness of which she is capable,’” 

</p>, <p>Miss Roberts said that above all, the Conservatives were a party of ordinary men and women taken from every walk of life that represented this nation. Considering what kind of thing everyone wanted in 1951, she said that first of all they would like to be certain of a peaceful future, and once that was secure they would like to be certain of jobs, homes, food, and a reasonable income which they could spend themselves, and, above all, of the right to live their own lives without interference by other people.

</p>, <p>How did this add up compared with where they were now, she asked, and went on to speak of the rapidly worsening financial position. They were once again in a position as a nation where they had a large debt this year running at the rate of £400,000,000 a year. This was the first thing any Government would have to face on its return.

</p>, <p>Going round canvassing she found that the problem which concerned everyone was the sharp increase in the cost of living which had taken place over the last few months and the way in which prices went up much more than wages. This was the second problem any Government would have to tackle if it was to govern the country successfully.

</p>, <p>The third thing, and the most important social problem, was the shortage of houses. It was a tragic thing that housing lists were longer in 1951 than they were in 1945. For those people who were in difficulties with housing it was the problem that came first in their minds and their lives, and therefore it was the duty of any Government to tackle that as social priority No. 1. These things she had mentioned were the important things apart from peace, which transcended all others.

</p>, <p>Ultimately the first problem—that of paying their way in the world—came down to how they could get greater production. That was perhaps the greatest industrial problem of all and concerned everyone from top to bottom employed in industry. One of the first points of Conservative policy was that if a man was a leader either with his brains, hands or his personality that man was invaluable to the nation because he stood for new creative industries which would provide employment for more and more people, and they said that where they found a person like that the utmost should be done to let him have licences to start up on his own and to free supplies of raw materials to him.

</p>, <p> “If a man has the guts and the know-how let him get on with the job,” declared Miss Roberts.” He is not doing harm but a tremendous amount of good to the nation.

</p>, <p> “That is the chief way in which our factories grew up here and sometimes when talking politically we do not think how these things started. Unless we carry on as a nation of creators then, because we are a small island with a large population, we shall not survive. When the Tory policy comes out and says ‘set people free’ that is the kind of thing they have in mind.” 

</p>, <p>Encouraging the people who “had got what it takes” eventually added to the benefit of everyone. But however good the leadership it did need backing up from the rank and file. Unless the rank and file played their part and said “We know that as a nation we are running at a debt and the only thing for each and all is to work a little bit harder” they would never close the dollar gap and would fall into more debt—and the end of debt was bankruptcy.

</p>, <p>They had to encourage the leaders, work as a team, and be prepared to work harder. What could a Government do to encourage that? It could either help or hinder, but one of the ways in which it could help was to see that those who earned a bit more in their wage packet because they worked harder, did not have that extra bit wholly taken in taxation. Extra skill and extra work must have extra reward, because unless that was so they would have a tremendous shortage of craftsmen, and they were in danger of that at the moment.

</p>, <p>There was another important thing. In this nation they had not a great many supplies of raw materials, and in importing these from overseas they were finding a certain amount of difficulty. Unless they found enough raw materials for their work people to fashion into finished goods, they would not have the raw materials for the people in the factories to work on, and that was the greatest danger at the moment to full employment. An extremely valuable source of raw material was the British Empire and Commonwealth. Therefore came another point of Conservative policy which was closely allied to greater production. “We must safeguard our right and the right of the colonies for them to have first preference to our markets and for us to have first right to theirs,” she said. She believed they could maintain this Imperial Preference because it was their duty to their own work people to see they, got supplies of raw materials and also their duty to these colonies to see their markets were not frustrated. <span class="page">[end p1]</span>

<span class="comment">(2) <i>Erith Observer</i>, 19 October 1991</span> </p>, <p class="nonmt">It was not so very long ago that Miss Margaret Roberts, 26-years-old Conservative candidate for Dartford, told supporters that she had set up bachelor-girl house-keeping. She commented at the time, “The only trouble is that there is only one to collect the weekly purchases—instead of two.” 

</p>, <p>Now all that is to be changed, for this week she stated she is going to marry a fellow-Conservative, Major Denis Thatcher, 36-years-old company director, of Erith. But they will wait until after the election.

</p>, <p>At the moment the engagement, although confirmed by Miss Roberts, is not an official one. Nothing must be allowed to interfere with the campaign to wrest the Dartford seat from its occupier for the past six years, Mr. Norman Dodds.

</p>, <p>No word about the impending news was breathed at the Bedon-well-hill Schools' meeting at Erith on Monday night, although Mr. Thatcher, chairman for the evening, was sitting next to Miss Roberts. In his opening remarks, however, he did say, “She has unlimited beauty brains and charm, three qualities which we can do with in the House of Commons.” 

</p>, <p>They first met in February, 1949, when Miss Roberts was chosen as prospective candidate. “Since then he has helped me tremendously on the economic and industrial side of politics,” smiled Miss Roberts.

</p>, <p>Major Thatcher is managing director of Atlas Preservative Company, the paint manufacturers, Fraser-road, Erith, and is chairman of the London Association of the National Paint Federation. A member of the Order of the British Empire, he was commissioned in the Royal Engineers and later was transferred to the Royal Regiment of Artillery. He gave full-time service from 1939 to 1946, becoming a brigade major. He saw service in Sicily, Italy and France, being twice mentioned in despatches. After demobilisation, he rejoined Atlas, for whom he had worked from 1934, and became general manager. In 1948 he was appointed managing director.
